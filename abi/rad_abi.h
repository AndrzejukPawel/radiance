/* ================================================================== the described launch */
/* A KERNEL THAT DESCRIBES ITS LAUNCH INSTEAD OF PERFORMING IT, so the runtime can turn one
 * description into either a dispatch or a graph node update.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The engine re-issues a fixed op sequence every step: the topology is identical
 * from step to step and only a few of the dispatches carry an operand that moved. The cost of
 * launching a graph is roughly flat in the number of nodes, while submitting the same dispatches
 * one at a time is linear in it, so replaying such a sequence as a graph is cheaper. What a
 * `launch` hook cannot support is the UPDATE: it performs the dispatch itself, marshalling its own
 * arguments, so nothing above it knows which argument slot holds which operand -- and a node update
 * needs exactly that slot. `describe` reports the dispatch instead of performing it.
 *
 * IT IS OPTIONAL. `launch` remains the required entry point and every kernel that only implements
 * it keeps working unchanged -- it simply never becomes a graph node, and a sequence containing
 * one is submitted the ordinary way. Implement `describe` for a kernel that is issued repeatedly
 * with a stable shape; there is nothing to gain on one that runs once.
 *
 * THE TRAP, AND THE ONE WAY TO AVOID IT. `launch` and `describe` must dispatch the SAME kernel
 * with the SAME arguments, and nothing can check that for you: a divergence is not a crash, it is
 * a wrong number produced only on the graph path, only after a capture, and it will read as a
 * numerics bug anywhere but here. Do NOT write the two bodies twice. Write the shape arithmetic
 * once and let it emit into a sink that is either a stream or a descriptor -- libr4d does this
 * with one macro, and an out-of-tree plugin should do the same.
 *
 * ALLOCATION-FREE, like `launch`. The runtime owns the RadLaunchDesc storage and keeps it alive
 * for as long as the node exists, so the shim writes its argument VALUES into `blob` and points
 * `params[i]` at them. Pointing `params[i]` at anything else is legal only if that storage
 * outlives the graph -- a string literal or the instance state does, a local does not. */

/* Fill `out[0..cap)` with the dispatches this call WOULD perform and write how many to `n_out`.
 * Most kernels emit one; a split-K kernel and its finisher emit two. Returns RAD_E_FULL without
 * writing anything if `cap` is too small, so the runtime can retry with a bigger array; returns
 * RAD_OK having written `*n_out` otherwise. Must not allocate, must not synchronise and must not
 * touch the device -- it is called at capture time, off the step path, and again whenever the
 * runtime needs to know whether an argument moved.
 *
 * IT DESCRIBES A KERNEL DISPATCH AND ONLY THAT. An op whose work is a memory copy -- libr4d's
 * `cast` is a hipMemcpy2DAsync, not a launch -- has nothing to put in a RadLaunchDesc and should
 * leave `describe` null. A graph can hold copy nodes, but expressing one would need a second
 * descriptor shape, and the ops that want it are the ops a graph saves least on.
 *
 * IT TAKES THE STREAM, because some launches depend on which one they are going onto: libr4d's
 * split-K GEMM takes its arrival counter from a per-stream pool, so a description made without
 * the stream would name a different counter than the launch would have used -- a divergence of
 * exactly the kind the paragraph above says nothing can check for you. The runtime passes the

 * and C", and for the engine to apply that repeatedly until the graph converges. spec.md §2.3
 * refuses the second half -- "a fusion rewriter is a compiler, and a compiler is the thing whose output nobody can
 * predict" -- and the declare phase keeps nothing a rewriter could work on in any case: `Program`
 * holds no operand edges. The Builder computes them, collapses each buffer's whole use-set to a
 * `first_def`/`last_use` pair with reads and writes MERGED, and discards the rest when it returns.
 * "Op A's output is op B's only input" is not recoverable from that, which is also why
 * `--debug-graph` declines to print an edge it cannot prove.
 *
 * So this is a DECLARATION, not a rewriter. Fusion stays a selection: the architecture asks for
 * the fused op and emits the sequence when nothing serves it (spec.md 2.3, and rad_op_resolved in
 * rad_builder.h, which is the idiom an out-of-tree plugin needs for a banded or optional fusion).
 * What the declaration adds is that the EQUIVALENCE becomes machine-readable instead of prose in a
 * kernel row -- "byte-identical to the two ops it replaces" -- and prose cannot be checked. It
 * buys three things:
 *
 *   AN ORACLE, which is the one that matters. A fused kernel with no libref counterpart can only
 *   be skipped by name, and such skips dominate what a coverage run reports on a model built out
 *   of fusions. A fused kernel that declares its chain can instead be checked against that chain
 *   run out of the SAME plugin's unfused rows -- which is precisely the claim the row makes, and
 *   a stronger test than a tolerance against ref, because the answer should be BYTE-IDENTICAL.
 *
 *   AN ADVISORY in --debug-graph: these N declared ops are a chain some kernel says it can do in
 *   one launch, and here is why it did not fire.
 *
 *   A COVERAGE METRIC, which spec.md:19 lists.
 *
 * WHY A HOOK AND NOT A TABLE. A step's geometry is not the fused op's geometry and is not always
 * derivable by a caller: `qk_norm_rope_gate` replaces an `rmsnorm` at M = T * n_head, and nothing
 * in the fused op's parameter list is that product. The kernel is the component that knows, which
 * is the same argument RadShapeFn and RadLayoutFn already make.
 *
 * OPERAND WIRING. Every operand of every step is either an operand of the FUSED kernel or a
 * TEMPORARY the chain passes between its own steps. A temporary needs no description here: it is
 * sized and typed by the step's own `opd_shape`, which every kernel that wants to be checked this
 * way already publishes. Note how often no temporary is needed at all -- the fp8 folds still WRITE
 * their intermediate when `out_bf16` is passed, precisely so the fused and unfused forms leave the
 * same buffers behind. */
