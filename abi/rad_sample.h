/* rad_sample.h -- the per-sequence sampling row, and why it is part of the ABI.
 *
 * Every sampler op takes `params` as an OPERAND: an array of the struct below, one row per sampled
 * position, uploaded once per step. That makes its layout a wire format between the core and every
 * kernel plugin, so it belongs here beside RadTensor rather than in core/sample/ where it started
 * -- a kernel plugin cannot include a core header, and a struct the host writes and the device
 * reads is a struct whose layout has to be STATED, not inferred.
 *
 * ============================== WHY NOT PARAMETERS ==============================
 *
 * `rep`, `freq`, `pres`, `k` and `p` read like op PARAMETERS, and docs/OPS.md names them that way.
 * They cannot be. Parameters are geometry: the selector matches constraints against them and they
 * are frozen at declare (spec §2.2). A per-sequence value cannot live there, and the failure is
 * not subtle -- two requests in one batch with different top_p would be two different geometries
 * and therefore two different resolutions of the same op, which is not something a batch can
 * contain. A deployment would have one top_p.
 *
 * So the values are DATA and they travel as an operand. `seed` and `offset`, which docs/OPS.md
 * gives `sample_pick` as two more operands, are fields of the row for the same reason.
 *
 * core/sample/sampler.h carries the full schema table this implies; libref implements it.

 *
 * RAD_SP_GREEDY OWNS THE ROW'S TOKEN. `sample_argmax` writes it, and every candidate stage after
 * it -- `sample_topk`, the narrowing stages, `sample_merge_topk` and `sample_pick` -- treats the
 * row as having no candidates and leaves `token` alone. A batch mixing greedy and sampled rows
 * issues both paths over every row, so a stage that ignored the flag would overwrite the argmax
 * with a draw. A greedy row that has to go through the candidate chain instead -- a split
 * vocabulary, where the argmax's column is not a token id -- is staged at top_k = 1 WITHOUT this

 * THE HISTORY WINDOW. `hist_off` and `hist_len` address the row's OWN row of the history plane,
 * [M, max_hist] int32 with row m belonging to sampled position m: the window is
 * history[m][hist_off .. hist_off + hist_len), clamped to the row. Token ids in it are GLOBAL

 *
 * `penalty_last_n` and `dry_penalty_last_n` window the TAIL of that span: 0 turns the stage off

 *
 * `dry_rep_limit` is the longest repeat DRY may count for the row, fixed by the most recent
 * sequence breaker in the DRY window (llama.cpp's `rep_limit`), or 0 when no breaker occurs there
 * and repeats are not limited. The breakers themselves are resolved against the vocabulary on the
 * host, which is also where that limit is found; see `sample_dry`'s optional `breakers` operand
