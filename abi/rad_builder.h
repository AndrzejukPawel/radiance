 * (RadBuildCtx::scope, spec §10, §11), so "the buffer called logits" is two different buffers in
 * one Program and matching on the string would sample the draft model's distribution into the
 * target's tokens. It is one call and it removes a string match from startup.
 *
 * Its extent along dim 0 bounds RadBatch::n_out: the buffer holds one row per sampled position,
 * not one per token of the step. Declaring it [max_tok, n_vocab] is legal and, at a 248K
 * vocabulary, 8 GiB.

 *
 * IT REPLACES A WEIGHT-NAME MATCH. The alternative is for the engine to decide whether a
 * container drafts by scanning the declared weights for names like `mtp.fc.weight` or
 * `dflash.fc.weight`, and then to re-read the drafter's own configuration keys -- block size,
 * mask token, sliding window, predicted-layer count -- every one of them a key the plugin has
 * already read to build the thing. Two readers of one fact is two places for it to disagree, and
 * the second reader would be the core, which is the one that must not know.
 *
 * KIND IS A SHAPE, NOT A MODEL. There are two ways a draft head can be driven and the difference
 * is visible from outside it: SERIAL runs `depth` dependent passes, each embedding what the last
 * one proposed, so the tokens arrive one at a time and a pass that declines ends the chain.
 * BLOCK runs a context pass and then ONE pass that fills every drafted position at once. MTP,
 * EAGLE and Medusa-serial are all SERIAL; DFlash2 and any other block-diffusion drafter is
 * BLOCK. A plugin picks the shape that describes it and needs no core change to do it.
 *
 * `proposal` is the buffer a pass writes its token ids into, and 0 means "the sampler's token
 * buffer" -- which is what a head whose logits go through the ordinary sampler chain wants. A
 * by-name lookup cannot supply this field: it would have to suffix-match a name that is not
 * unique in the Program, in exactly the way the comment above rad_declare_logits explains is
 * wrong -- a drafter declares into its own scope.
 *
 * A plugin that declares no drafter is not an error and is the normal case; the scheduler's
 * prompt-lookup drafter still runs. */
