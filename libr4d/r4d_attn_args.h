/* r4d_attn_args.h -- the paged-attention operand list, read once for four kernel geometries.
 *
 * The paged kernels -- h256/gqa6, h128/gqa4 and the gqa8/gqa12 instantiations, prefill and decode
 * -- take the SAME operands in the same order, because they implement the same op. The reader for
 * that list therefore belongs to the family rather than to any one of them, and this is where it
 * lives: a header beside the kernels, included by each unit's entry point.
 *
 * It is NOT a translation layer. libr4d's R4DArgs carries the same convention RadTensor does --
 * strides in ELEMENTS (spec 2.1) -- so this is field extraction plus the validation a constraint
 * cannot do: a constraint settles whether a kernel EXISTS for a geometry and says nothing about a
 * particular call, so contiguity, alignment and buffer sizes are checked here and refused with the
 * code that names the class.
 *
 * The kernels already return a negative code for a shape they do not serve (-1 head_dim or
 * block_size, -2 gqa, -4 too many decode rows, -100-hipError for a launch failure) and those are
 * passed through unchanged: a caller that gets one has hit a selection bug, and the exact value is
 * what says which.

 * RAGGED BATCHES. libr4d's paged kernels take a scalar q_len AND an optional cu_seqlens, and which
 * one this call uses is decided here. Without cu_seqlens every sequence in the batch has to present
 * the same query length, which is a restriction the scheduler does not honour and cannot be asked
 * to: core/sched/scheduler.cpp builds RAD_PHASE_MIXED steps deliberately, because a decode row
 * costs nothing once another sequence's prefill chunk is already reading the weights. A step that
 * mixes them has total_q that need not divide n_seq, and refusing that with RAD_E_SHAPE would be
 * reported by the run phase as a kernel that does not serve the shape, which aborts the engine. So
 * the operand is passed whenever it is there and the uniform arithmetic is kept only for the case
 * where it is not.
 *
 * q_len then means the batch MAXIMUM, and it comes from the PARAMETER, which is exactly what the
 * arch block issued the op with (RAD_ISSUE_N(..., batch->max_q_len, ...)). Deriving it from the
 * tensors is only possible in the uniform case, and that is what the code below does there --
 * total_q / num_seqs -- because the parameter is a band bound there, not a count.
