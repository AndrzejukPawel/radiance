// r4d_fp8_lm.h -- the STORED ROW GEOMETRY of the fp8 lm_head, and nothing else. Pure C++: no HIP,
// no r4d.h, so the host layout hook (r4d_fp8_layout.cpp), the device entry point
// (r4d_gemm_fp8a16_nt_m1.hip) and the selftest all derive the row width from the same line instead
// of writing `K + 2 * (K / 128)` four times and drifting.
//
// WHY THE ROW LOOKS LIKE THIS AT ALL is r4d_rad_layout_fp8_logits' argument and is not repeated
// here: `logits_gemm` carries ONE weight operand, so the block scales have nowhere to go but the
// row's own tail, and that is what keeps a row-sharded lm_head a plain byte range under tensor
// parallelism.
//
// ---- THE PADDING, which is the only thing this header adds to `K + 2*nkb` ---------------------
//
// Both kernels that read this plane -- the M <= 2 matvec and the WMMA tile above it -- load the
// weight SIXTEEN BYTES AT A TIME through a uint4, at `row * w_ld + (a multiple of 16)`. So the row
// pitch has to be a multiple of 16 or every odd row is misaligned, and the unpadded width is a
// multiple of 16 only when
//
//     K + 2*(K/128) = 130m  (K = 128m)   is 0 mod 16   <=>   m is 0 mod 8   <=>   K is 0 mod 1024
//
// which is a property of the MODEL, not of anything the kernel chose. K = 5120 has it; K = 2560
// does not. Without the pad such a head cannot be served in fp8 at all: it falls to the bf16
// projection, which reads twice the bytes and is then the single largest op in the step -- for
// want of eight bytes a row.
//
// So pad. The cost is under 16 bytes on a row that is already K + K/64 long -- 0.3% at K = 2560,
// and ZERO at every K that is a multiple of 1024, where the rounding is a no-op and the plane is
// byte-for-byte the unpadded one. **The padding never changes a valid container's plane**, and
// that is not luck: the layout hook refuses a K without the property rather than writing a plane
// its own kernels would fault on, so every K a container can already hold is one the rounding
// leaves alone.
//
// This is NOT the padding r4d_gemm_fp8a16_nt_m1.hip's header prices and rejects. That one is about
// padding an ALREADY-ALIGNED 5200-byte row out to 5376 to make it 128-aligned, chasing the
// cacheline straddle, and it loses to FK = 256. This is 16-byte alignment, which is a correctness
// floor rather than a tuning knob, and it is what decides whether the row can be served at all.
