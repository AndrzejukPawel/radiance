#!/bin/sh
# One row per device kernel in a build tree: VGPRs, SGPRs, LDS bytes, scratch bytes, spilled
# registers, the waves a SIMD the VGPR count alone allows, and the workgroup size.
#
#   BUILD=/path/to/build res.sh
#
# SPILL IS THE LOUD COLUMN, and SCRATCH after it: spilled registers are a memory round trip the
# source does not show, and scratch without spills is a private array the compiler could not keep
# in registers. WAVES is the other one: on gfx1201 a SIMD has 1536 VGPRs in wave32 allocated in
# groups of 8, so 256 VGPRs is 6 waves and 128 is 12 -- and LDS can cut it further, which this
# column does NOT model.
#
# The metadata is msgpack printed as YAML and its keys are ALPHABETICAL, so .vgpr_count comes after
# .symbol and .sgpr_count before it. Emitting a row at .symbol prints the previous kernel's VGPR
# count. The row is flushed at .wavefront_size, which is last.
