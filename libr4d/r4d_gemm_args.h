/* r4d_gemm_args.h -- the skinny GEMMs' operand list and their split law.
 *
 * The launch law -- ladders, caps, `pick_sk`, a bound rule per weight grid -- lives beside the
 * kernels it decides for, so a kernel library built out of tree carries its own rule instead of
 * depending on one held in the engine. The declared tunable axes (r4d_rows.cpp) are the half of
 * that a tuner walks; this is the half that answers when a shape is left on the axis defaults.
 *
 * The operand plumbing is here for the ordinary reason: eleven kernels across eleven translation
 * units read the same two operand lists -- [A, B, Y] for the bf16 grid and [A, a_scale, B,
 * b_scale, Y, a_sum, B_ref] for every quantised one -- because they implement two ops.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ the split count
 *
 * libr4d's skinny GEMMs put split-K IN THE WORKGROUP: SK k-splits per column tile, reduced in LDS,
 * which is what fills a 64-CU part at M=1. The legality rule is K % (SK * unit) == 0, so no single
 * SK is legal at every K -- and a DEFAULT that is illegal at a shape would make an untuned install
 * FAIL rather than be slow, which is the wrong way round (spec §15).
 *
 * So the `sk` axis carries 0 as its DEFAULT and 0 means "the largest legal split from this K",
 * resolved here. The candidate ladder is the set of split counts that tuned configurations use, in
 * descending order, so an untuned install lands on a split count some shape was tuned to rather
 * than on 1. The cost of the sentinel is that two shapes with different K both running
 * `sk = 0` get different split counts; --debug-graph prints the chosen point, so a 0 there has to
 * be read as "the law decided" and not as a number.
 */
/* THE LAUNCH BOUND IS PART OF A SPLIT'S LEGALITY.
 *
 * libr4d's skinny kernels carry __launch_bounds__ that TIGHTEN as MB and NPW grow -- w2a8's is
 * (MB >= 4) ? 256 : ((MB >= 2 || NPW >= 4) ? 512 : 1024) -- and a block of WV*SK*32 threads wider
 * than its own bound is a launch failure, which surfaces later as a device error from whatever
 * happens to synchronise next. A split count picked against a flat 1024 is therefore not
 * necessarily legal.
 *
 * MB comes from M (`ceil(M/16)`, capped at 4), so this is an M-dependent trap that only springs
 * under CONCURRENCY. On the DFlash2 2-bit draft head, N = 248320: M >= 49 gives MB = 4 and a bound
 * of 256, where sk = 10 asks for 320 threads a block; M in [17, 48] gives MB = 2 and a bound of
 * 512, where sk = 20 asks for 640. Any bench that runs M <= 16 sees none of it. The engine refuses
 * the op at issue and fails the step, exactly as spec 17 says it must, so the symptom is
 * concurrent requests coming back empty rather than a wrong number.
 *
 * EACH CALLER NAMES ITS OWN RULE, because they genuinely differ and one conservative rule costs
 * real throughput: the bf16, w4a16, w8a16 and mxfp4 kernels declare a flat 1024 (or no
 * __launch_bounds__ at all, which is the same 1024), and capping them as if they were w2a8 costs
 * prefill throughput for nothing. w4a8 tightens on NPW alone and w8a8 on MT*NPW, both because the
 * bound is a REGISTER budget, which their own headers say at length. Where a kernel's macro is
 * switched off by a build flag the TIGHT branch is named here anyway: over-constraining a build
 * that relaxed its bound loses a little parallelism, and under-constraining one that did not is the
 * launch failure above.
