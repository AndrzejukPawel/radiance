/* r4d_layout.cpp -- what libr4d's integer and MXFP4 GEMMs store for a weight, and the relayouts
 * that produce it from the weight's canonical planes (spec.md §4.3). Pure host C++: nothing here
 * includes r4d.h or <hip/hip_runtime.h>, so it compiles and can be exercised on a box with no
 * ROCm, which is where a packing bug is cheapest to find.
 *
 * A container holds each weight's encoding -- codes, scales and zero points, canonical and
 * row-major -- and the kernel that reads it rearranges it at load. That is what lets this file
 * change a fragment order without anyone converting a model again; the numbers were chosen by a
 * quantiser (libquant), and nothing here chooses one.
 *
 * THE FRAGMENT ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. gfx1201's wave32 WMMA fragment layout is
 *
 *     idx = lane % 16 ,  k = 8*(e>>2) + 4*(lane>>4) + (e&3)
 *
 * so a B fragment maps lane l onto output row l&15: in canonical order the sixteen lanes of a
 * half-wave read sixteen rows K/2 bytes apart, which is a fully strided read on the operand that
 * dominates traffic. Rearranged, a wave's weight load for four k steps is one 512-byte
 * global_load_b128 with a constant stride and no address arithmetic in the loop.
 *
 * Every element->slot map below is transcribed from the kernel that reads it; the comment at the
 * top of each libr4d GEMM states it in closed form.

/* ================================================================== moe w4
 *
 * THE GROUPED MoE GEMM'S 4-BIT EXPERT WEIGHT, and it is a different plane from the dense w4 above
 * for one structural reason: the dense kernels read a WMMA fragment straight out of a coalesced
 * global load, so their weight is stored PERMUTED into fragment order; the grouped kernel stages
 * its weight through LDS -- it has to, because eight M tiles share one N tile of it -- so a
 * permutation would buy nothing and would have to be undone on the way in.
 *
 * WHAT THE FORMAT IS
 *
 *   weight  [N][K/2] bytes, row-major, TWO'S COMPLEMENT codes -8..7 -- an ordinary symmetric
 *           int4 grid, the one GPTQ and every other 4-bit method is written against.
 *   scale   [N][K/group] bf16, one per row per group of 128 along K. w ~= code * scale.
 *
 * THE DECODE IS TWO V_PERM_B32 AND A THIRD THAT CHOOSES BETWEEN THEM. A perm is a byte permute of
 * an EIGHT-byte source, so one table holds eight entries and a two's complement nibble needs
 * sixteen. Indexing both a positive and a negative table with the low three bits and selecting on
 * bit 3 -- by ADDING 4 to a selector byte, which cannot carry -- gets all sixteen levels for five
 * more VALU per eight weights than a fifteen-level sign-magnitude grid would cost. r4d_moe.hip's
 * w4_e4m3 is the five lines.
 *
 * THE INTEGERS -8..7 ARE ALL EXACT IN E4M3 (three mantissa bits reach 16), so expanding a code to an
 * E4M3 byte is lossless and the product the WMMA computes is code * activation with no rounding
 * the fp8 path did not already have. That is the whole reason this weight can ride the existing
 * f32_16x16x16_fp8_fp8 inner loop untouched: only the STAGING changes.
 *
 * THE NIBBLE ORDER IS THE ONE THE EXPANSION WANTS. Byte b of a packed dword holds element b in its
 * low nibble and element b+4 in its high nibble, so the two masks above produce elements 0..3 and
 * 4..7 already in order and nothing has to be interleaved afterwards. It is the same argument the
 * dense w4a8 kernel's header makes for the same pair of masks.
 *
 * IT IS NOT SHARDABLE AND THE ARCHITECTURE SAYS SO. A packed row is K/2 bytes and a column shard
 * would cut a byte in half; an expert under expert parallelism is whole on one rank, which is the
 * only configuration that declares this format. rad_block_moe_fp8.h refuses a width-sharded
 * declaration by name rather than leaving it to the loader to discover.
 */
/* THE ROTATED FORM IS THE SAME BYTES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS IN THEM, and that is exactly why the
 * encoding says so. `dtype=w4a8h` serves `i4*bf16[1x128]/fwht128`: every group of K was multiplied
 * by a `group`-wide Hadamard before it was quantised. Nothing in the packing, the extents or the
 * byte count would say so, and a weight quantised one way and served the other reads as noise --
 * so the layout hook accepts exactly the encoding the dtype names, and refuses the other at
 * declare.
 *
 * THE KERNEL DOES NOT BRANCH ON IT. <Hw, Ha> = group * <w, a>, and the residual factor is folded
 * into the stored weight scale by the quantiser (docs/MOE-W4.md), so the GEMM multiplies codes by
 * scales exactly as it does for the unrotated grid. What has to agree is the ACTIVATION: the
 * routed experts' input must be quantised by the rotated quantiser at the same width, which is
 * what had_quant_act_fp8 is for. That pairing is not checkable from here -- it is a property of the
 * graph, and the arch block that declares one declares the other. */
/* THE CODEBOOK FORM IS THE ROTATED FORM WITH OTHER NUMBERS FOR THE SAME CODES. `dtype=w4nla8h`
 * serves `u4*bf16[1x128]/fwht128` whose codes index a sixteen-entry `table` plane -- libquant's
 * `table=w4nl` -- and the kernel decodes that table and no other (r4d_args.h). An encoding cannot
 * say what its table holds, so the codes view selects the table plane beside the codes and the
 * relayout compares it with the kernel's, value for value, before it serves a byte: a container
 * quantised against another table is refused at load rather than served as other numbers. */
