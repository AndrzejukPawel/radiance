 * that adapter would live in this repository where they cannot reach it.
 *
 * What this header holds is the part that is not translation: reading a parameter, finding an
 * operand, asking whether a tensor is contiguous. Every plugin needs it, none of it is libr4d's,
 * and most of it is one line over rad_abi.h -- which is the shape a shared helper should have.
 *
 * Nothing here includes r4d.h or HIP: a host translation unit (the row table, the layouts, the
 * shape hooks) includes this too, and that split is what lets the tables a transcription error
 * hides in be compiled and read on a machine with no ROCm.
