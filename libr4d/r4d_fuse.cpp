/* r4d_fuse.cpp -- what chain of conventional ops does this kernel compute in one launch.
 *
 * `RadKernelInfo::replaces` (rad_abi.h) turns a claim that sixteen rows of this plugin make in
 * PROSE -- "byte-identical to the two ops it replaces" -- into something a tool can execute. The
 * value is an ORACLE: eleven of libr4d's fusions have no libref kernel at all, so rad-kbench
 * otherwise skips them BY NAME. A fused row that names its chain can be run against that chain
 * built out of THIS PLUGIN'S OWN unfused rows, and the answer should not be within a tolerance --
 * it should be the same bytes.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITY FOR EVERY CHAIN BELOW IS THE DEVICE KERNEL, not the row's prose and not this file.
 * A fusion is exact or it is not, and the difference is one `f2bf` in a kernel body: the fp8 folds
 * round their intermediate to bf16 and read it back precisely so that the fused and unfused forms
 * agree, and the int8 folds deliberately do NOT, because their reference is a different pair. So
 * each chain below names the libr4d source and the line that decides it, and a reader can check
 * one against the other. That is not decoration. `qk_norm_rope_gate` is the worked counter-example
 * -- it folds a sum of squares over one wave per head where `rmsnorm` folds it over
 * r4d_act_threads(M, n) threads, so the two differ by a ULP and it publishes NO HOOK -- and the ABI
 * says why: "a kernel that is merely close to the sequence it names should publish no hook at all",
 * because a false failure is worse than a skip and drowns the true ones.
 *
 * ============================================================ WHICH OPERANDS THE CALL PASSES
 *
 * `rmsnorm_quant_fp8` computes `add` then `rmsnorm` then the quantiser when it is given a residual,
 * and `rmsnorm` then the quantiser when it is not: THE CHAIN LENGTH DEPENDS ON AN OPERAND. That is
 * the reason the chain is a hook rather than a table, and the reason the hook has to be told which
 * operands the call carries rather than only `(p, n_p)`.
 *
 * Two other ways of deciding it look plausible and both are wrong:
 *
 *   DERIVE IT FROM A PARAMETER. There is no such parameter, and `wadd` in particular is not one.
 *       `wadd` is GemmaRMSNorm's `1 +` -- a property of the norm GAIN, not of the residual -- and
 *       arch/common/rad_fp8.h:369 passes it unconditionally in both forms. Keying on it would
 *       answer "three steps" for a Gemma-style model that passes no residual and "two steps" for a
 *       Llama-style one that does, which is a wrong chain rather than a missing one.
 *
 *   DECLARE BOTH WIRINGS WITH RAD_FUSE_NONE. That spelling marks an OPTIONAL operand of a STEP
 *       that this chain does not pass. It cannot express this difference, because the operands that
 *       vary are REQUIRED ones -- `add`'s `b` and `rmsnorm`'s `x` -- and because the CHAIN LENGTH
 *       itself changes, which no per-operand marker reaches.
 *
 * So the ABI carries it: `present` is a bit per operand of the fused op, and this file reads it
 * with RAD_FUSE_HAS(). A caller that genuinely does not know passes RAD_FUSE_PRESENT_ALL, which
 * means "answer for every operand your own description says exists" -- and that is a contract
 * rather than a coupling, because this plugin's `r4d_shape_rmsnorm_quant_fp8` publishes all six as
 * present and is the list a cold caller allocated from.
 *
 * Note how the question VANISHES wherever a fold's step carries the same optional operand the fold
 * does: `ar_rmsnorm_quant_fp8` below wires its residual and its out_bf16 straight through to a
 * `rmsnorm_quant_fp8` step where both are optional as well, so absence propagates and that chain
 * needs no knowledge of presence at all. That is worth preferring where a chain has the choice.
 *
 * ============================================================ WHAT IS DECLINED, AND WHY
 *
 * A decline is a real answer here, the same way it is in r4d_shapes.cpp: the caller counts the row
 * as uncovered, which is true, where a chain that is merely close produces a FAILURE that means
 * nothing. These rows carry a null `replaces` deliberately.
 *
 *   rmsnorm_had_quant_i8, gated_had_quant_i8, gdn_gated_norm_had_quant_i8
 *       NOT because the vocabulary has no `hadamard` op -- it does not, but that is not what stops
 *       these. The rotation is inside `had_quant_act_i8`, which IS an op, so the algebra
 *       `rmsnorm` + `had_quant_act_i8` is available and it still does not hold. The reason is the
 *       fusion's own trick: r4d_rmsnorm_had_quant_i8.hip runs the FWHT on `x * (w + wadd)` BEFORE
 *       the norm closes -- legitimate, since the transform is linear and `inv_rms` is a per-row
 *       scalar that the int8 codes cancel -- and folds `inv_rms` into `S[row]` instead. So the
 *       codes are taken over values that were never normalised and never rounded to bf16, while
 *       the unfused pair would rotate a stored bf16 norm output. That file states the gap itself
 *       ("normalising from a bf16-rounded sum produces thousands of +/-1 code errors and a 1e-3
 *       scale error against 5e-7") and calls storing bf16 correct and normalising from it not.
 *       r4d_gated_had_quant_i8.hip is the same shape and says so outright: "silu(x) = x *
 *       sigmoid(x) is computed in fp32. Doing it in bf16 would cost more than the quantiser that
 *       follows" -- which is the exact opposite of the fp8 sibling's bargain, and it is what makes
 *       `silu_mul` + `had_quant_act_i8` a different function. That row also reads a CLIP from the
 *       environment (R4D_CLIP_MLP_DOWN), so it is not even a pure function of the geometry.
 *
 *   had_quant_act_i8, quant_act_i8, quant_act_fp8
 *       NOT FUSIONS. They are primitive ops of the vocabulary with nothing to decompose into: the
 *       rotation has no op name of its own, and a chain of one step naming the op itself would be
 *       a tautology that inflates the coverage metric and checks nothing.
 *
 *   ar_ln_had_quant_i8
 *       The collective's half is expressible -- `all_reduce` then `rmsnorm_had_quant_i8`, both ops
 *       -- and the arithmetic is not. r4d_ar_ln_had_quant_i8.hip states its whole design as "the
 *       all-reduce OUTPUT never exists ... the peer's contribution is simply a second operand on
 *       the norm's load -- `t = mine + peer + residual`": one f32 expression, with no bf16 round
 *       between the reduce and the add. The pair it would replace has one, because the standalone
 *       all-reduce stores bf16. Its `ARN_W6_MATCH` makes only the COMPRESSED wire round, and only
 *       to match the compressed all-reduce. The fp8 sibling below took the opposite decision --
 *       `a = f2bf(bf2f(xr[i]) + bf2f(pr[i])); xr[i] = a;` -- and that one difference is why one of
 *       these two rows gets a hook and the other does not.
 *
 *   qk_norm_rope_gate
 *       Stated in docs/OPS.md and in the row itself: "It is not byte-identical to the four kernels
 *       it replaces", the summation partition differs, and selecting it is a rebaseline.
 *
 *   sample_chain
 *       It "stands beside the decomposed stages rather than replacing them" (r4d_rows.cpp). One
 *       workgroup walking an L2-resident row is not eight launches over a 248K vocabulary in any
 *       rounding sense, nothing in this project implements those eight on a device, and the fused
 *       row additionally produces `tok_excl` and `p_query`, which no chain of them writes.
 *
 *   dflash_conv, dflash_select, the five gdn_* rows
 *       "Neither op has an unfused equivalent in the vocabulary" (r4d_shapes.cpp), and the GDN
 *       preamble's constituents -- a causal conv against a state cache, an L2 norm, a per-chunk
 *       gate cumsum -- have no op names either.
 *
 * NO TUNED AXIS IS READ HERE, for the reason r4d_shapes.cpp gives about extents: no axis this
 * plugin declares changes WHAT a kernel computes. They name tile shapes, split counts, wave
 * counts and all-reduce launch geometry. An axis that changed the chain would be read from `p`,
 * where the core appends the chosen point alongside the geometry.
 *
 * Pure host code: no r4d.h, no HIP. It is in the CMake `SOURCES` list beside r4d_rows.cpp,
 * r4d_layout.cpp and r4d_shapes.cpp for the reason that split exists -- the tables a transcription
 * error hides in should compile and be readable on a box with no ROCm.

 * That distinction is the reason to read the kernel rather than the row's prose: the other choice
 * produces a chain that fails a byte comparison for no visible reason. The two candidates differ
 * in ONE place -- which value the sum of squares is taken over:
 *
 *   this kernel   `h = f2bf(bf2f(rr[i]) + bf2f(xr[i])); rr[i] = h; v = bf2f(h); ss += v * v;`
 *                 The sum is rounded to bf16, STORED, and read back before the variance. Its own
 *                 entry point says so in as many words: "`res += x` in f32, ROUNDED TO BF16 and
 *                 stored, and the norm is then taken of the stored value -- which is bit-for-bit
 *                 the `add` + `rmsnorm` pair this replaces".
 *
 *   rmsnorm_add   `float v = ldt(x, ..) + ldt(res, ..); ss += v * v; stt(ro, .., v);`
 *                 (libref/ref_elementwise.cpp). The variance comes off the UNROUNDED f32 sum
 *                 and only the multiply reads the stored value back. That file calls the choice
 *                 "THE ROUNDING IS THE CONTRACT" and is right to -- it is vLLM's
 *                 fused_add_rms_norm -- but it is a different function from this kernel's, by
 *                 half a ULP on every channel, and the whole point of the declaration is that a
 *                 caller may compare the bytes.
 *
 * So the residual add is spelled as the op that actually matches, and the payoff is larger than
 * correctness alone: `add`, `rmsnorm` and `quant_act_fp8` are all rows of THIS plugin
 * (add_bf16, rmsnorm_bf16, quant_act_fp8), so the chain can be checked libr4d-against-libr4d,
 * which is the byte-identical comparison the ABI describes rather than a tolerance against a host
 * oracle. `rmsnorm_add` has no libr4d row at all and would have forced the check cross-plugin.
 *
 * THE BYTE-IDENTITY RESTS ON THE WORKGROUP WIDTH AGREEING, which is worth knowing because it is
 * the thing most likely to break silently. Both kernels pick their thread count from
 * `r4d_act_threads(M, n)` and the width decides which columns a thread folds into the sum of
 * squares; r4d_model_bf16.hip's launcher says "r4d_rmsnorm_quant_fp8 calls the SAME function, and
 * it has to". `M` is mirrored verbatim below for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Step 0 writes its output INTO the fused residual operand, which is both its own `b` and the
 * fused kernel's INOUT residual. That is not an accident of the wiring: the fused kernel overwrites
 * the residual in place, so a chain that wrote the sum anywhere else would leave a different set of
 * buffers behind and the comparison would miss the difference. `add_bf16` is safe in place --
 * binary_kernel reads a[i] and b[i] and writes y[i], one element per thread, no neighbours.
 *
 * Step 1's `y` is fused operand 5 rather than a temporary, and the ABI's own note explains why:
 * the fold still WRITES its intermediate when asked to, precisely so that the fused and unfused
 * forms leave the same buffers behind. `norm_quant_row` stores exactly the bf16 it then quantises
 * (`h = f2bf(bf2f(nr[c]) * rs * (g + wadd)); if (yr) yr[c] = h; v[j] = bf2f(h);`), so operand 5 is

 *
 * THIS ONE IS EXPRESSIBLE AND ITS SIBLING ABOVE IS NOT, which is the opposite of what the operand
 * lists suggest, and the kernel says why in a comment written for exactly this question:
 *
 *     const uint16_t ab = f2bf(ACT == 0 ? gv / (1.0f + expf(-gv)) : 1.0f / (1.0f + expf(-gv)));
 *     const uint16_t h  = f2bf(bf2f(ab) * bf2f(xr[c]));
 *     // THE ACTIVATION IS ROUNDED BEFORE THE MULTIPLY, which is the one place this differs from
 *     // gated_quant_fp8 above and it is not an oversight. [...] This one's is `sigmoid` then
 *     // `mul`, TWO kernels with a bf16 buffer between them -- so the round trip is part of the
 *     // arithmetic being replaced, and skipping it changes the model's output. [...]
 *
 * That round trip is the chain. `sigmoid_bf16` computes `f32_to_bf16(1.0f / (1.0f +
 * expf(-bf2f(xr[i]))))` and `mul_bf16` computes `f32_to_bf16(bf2f(a) * bf2f(b))`, which are the
 * two lines above term for term, and the gate arrives as its own [M, n] operand so there is no
 * half-of-an-operand problem. Three launches an attention layer becoming one is what the fusion
 * bought; the three are named here.
 *
 * `act` silu IS DECLINED, and not because the arithmetic differs -- `silu` is an op of the
 * vocabulary and `f2bf(gv / (1.0f + expf(-gv)))` is what a silu step would have to compute. It is
 * declined because THIS PLUGIN HAS NO `silu` ROW: libr4d declares `sigmoid` (sigmoid_bf16) and
 * `silu_mul` (silu_mul_bf16) and no bare `silu`, so the only implementation a caller could reach
 * is libref's, whose `act_silu(x)` is `x * act_sigmoid(x)` -- two f32 roundings where this
 * kernel does one divide. A chain that resolved there would report a difference in the last bit of
 * every element and call it a fault in the kernel, and a false failure is worse than a skip. A
 * libr4d `silu` row spelled `x / (1 + expf(-x))` would close the gap; without one the decline
 * stands. Nothing in the tree issues this row with silu -- the gated attention's gate is a
 * sigmoid, which is why the shim's `mode` defaults to 1.
 *
 * TMP(0) is act(gate): an [M, n] bf16 plane the fusion genuinely never writes, so it is a
 * temporary rather than an operand. `out_bf16` is not -- the kernel stores the product there when
 * asked, and the codes are taken over those same bytes.

 * reduction, which is exact and order-free however it is regrouped across the waves" -- and this
 * is that sentence made executable. Both steps are libr4d rows, so the check is
 * libr4d-against-libr4d.
 *
 * TMP(0) IS THE ONE GENUINE TEMPORARY IN THIS FILE: the [M, N] bf16 plane the unfused pair passed
 * between the GEMM and the quantiser, and the plane whose non-existence is the entire point of the
 * fusion ("no [M, 2n] tensor is ever written"). Its extents come from step 0's own `opd_shape`,
 * which is the ABI's rule for a temporary, and `r4d_shape_gemm_nt_q` answers [M, N] bf16 for
 * operand 4 while `r4d_shape_gated_quant_fp8` answers [M, 2n] for operand 0 -- the same plane,
 * since `n` below is N/2.
 *
 * TWO PLACES WHERE A PARAMETER CANNOT SIMPLY BE COPIED, and both are the kind of thing that
 * resolves to a plausible wrong kernel rather than to an error:
 *
 *   `n`      is N/2 and not N. `N` on the fused op is the WEIGHT'S ROWS -- twice the fused width,
 *            gate then up -- which is exactly why this op has a schema of its own rather than a
 *            flag on `gemm_nt_q`. The quantiser's row is the OUTPUT width.
 *
 *   `dtype`  is "bf16" on the quantiser step and "fp8a8" on the GEMM step, from one key on the
 *            fused op. `dtype` names the operand COMBINATION for a GEMM and the width of the
 *            tensor an activation op READS, and the constraint rows disagree accordingly:
 *            cGemmNtQGatedFp8 has `C_IN("dtype", "fp8a8")` and cGatedQuantFp8 has
 *            `C_IN("dtype", "bf16")`. Mirroring the fused value into step 1 would match no row of
 *            this plugin, and the chain would be unresolvable rather than wrong -- but only
 *            because nothing else declares a bf16-named `gated_quant_fp8`, which is not a
 *            guarantee worth relying on.
 *
 * `a_sum` and `b_ref` are the two operands libr4d appended after `gemm_nt_q`'s `y`, and an fp8
 * grid has neither -- `a_sum` belongs to the asymmetric integer grids and `b_ref` to mxfp4, and
 * r4d_shape_gemm_nt_q says the same by describing both as absent. They are RAD_FUSE_NONE and not
 * simply omitted, because ONE ENTRY PER SCHEMA OPERAND is what makes the count a drift check.

 *
 * THE CHEAPEST HONEST CHAIN IN THE FILE, and the one that needs no assumption about optional
 * operands at all. Its second step is `rmsnorm_quant_fp8`, which is itself an op of the vocabulary
 * and carries the SAME two optional operands in the same positions -- so `residual` and `out_bf16`
 * are wired straight through and absence propagates through the wiring rather than having to be
 * observed. That is worth noticing as a design rule: a fold whose tail is itself a declared op
 * hands the discrimination to the step, and the ABI gap described in the file header disappears.
 *
 * BOTH WIRES, and the kernel earns the claim rather than approximating it. On the exact wire pass
 * one is `a = f2bf(bf2f(xr[i]) + bf2f(pr[i])); xr[i] = a;` -- the standalone one-shot's own f32 sum
 * stored as bf16, written back into `x` so that "a reader of `x` that is not this norm still finds
 * the same bytes". On the compressed wire the reduce loop stores the inverse-rotated sum into `x`
 * as bf16 "which is what the standalone compressed all-reduce wrote, so pass two below reads the
 * bytes it would have read". Everything after the handshake is `norm_quant_row`, the same device
 * function the standalone fold above runs. Contrast `ar_ln_had_quant_i8`, which takes the opposite
 * decision (`t = mine + peer + residual` with no round between) and therefore publishes no hook.
 *
 * THREE PARAMETERS THAT ARE NOT COPIES, and each of them decides which all-reduce row serves the
 * step:
 *
 *   `numel`      is M * n. The fused op declares the message by its [M, n] operand and
 *                `all_reduce` declares it as an element count -- and as THE LARGEST message the
 *                instance will carry, not the one a step passes, which is why the band's high
 *                bound is the right value and `pi` reads a range as one.
 *
 *   `exact`      is the fused `wire` inverted. It is REQUIRED on `all_reduce` and it is the
 *                predicate that separates cArExact from cArWht6; a caller that does not declare it
 *                gets no kernel at all.
 *
 *   `min_bytes`  is 0, and ONLY on the compressed wire. The wht6 shim serves a message below its
 *                floor with the EXACT kernel instead -- safe, because both kernels share the
 *                instance's scratch and flag space -- and the fused kernel has no such fallback: a
 *                `wire` of 6 is 6 at every size. Its comment names the spelling for this exact
 *                case: "A caller that needs the rotated wire unconditionally asks for a floor of
 *                0." Leaving the key out would let a small message go out exact on one side of the
 *                comparison and rotated on the other.
 *
 * `hops` is deliberately NOT emitted. A query that omits it falls through to the one-shot rows,
 * which is what this kernel is; naming it would be pinning a topology that does not exist at two
 * ranks. `y` is RAD_FUSE_NONE: the fused kernel reduces in place into `x`, which is what the
 * one-shot rows do and what the two-shot rows refuse by name.
