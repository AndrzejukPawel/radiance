// Shared device-side machinery for the BLOCK-SCALED FP8 family: the 16x16x16 fp8 WMMA fragment
// map, the E4M3 decoders, and the bf16 block-scale load. Named for what it is rather than for a
// kernel, like r4d_common.h and r4d_gdn_wmma.h, because it provides none.
//
// ---- the lane->element mapping, which AMD does not document ------------------------------------
//
// AMD does not publish it, and ROCm issue #6025, which asks for it, is closed without an answer.
// With lane `l`, `c = l % 16`, `h = l / 16` it is:
//
//   A, row-major A[m][k]     lane l holds A[c][h*8 + j],  j = 0..7
//   B, row-major B[k][n]     lane l holds B[h*8 + j][c],  j = 0..7
//   C/D accumulator          acc[j] IS D[h*8 + j][c]
//
// The accumulator is COLUMN-distributed: a lane owns one column and eight consecutive rows, lanes
// 0-15 rows 0-7 and lanes 16-31 rows 8-15. The intuitive "a lane owns a row" is wrong, produces a
// silently transposed tile, and gives no compile or runtime error.
//
// IDENTITY, DIAGONAL AND SYMMETRIC TEST MATRICES CANNOT TELL THE TWO APART -- both give 0 errors.
// Any test of fragment code here must use asymmetric operands.
//
// ---- the K labelling ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The canonical hardware K-order is not contiguous: lanes 0-15 really hold k = 0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11.
// Calling slot j of lane-half h "k = 8h + j" above is a permutation of K applied IDENTICALLY to A
// and B, and D = sum_k A[m][k] B[k][n] is invariant under it, so the product is bit-identical. Two
// rules keep it that way:
//
//   1. BOTH OPERANDS must use this labelling. If one ever comes from GLOBAL_LOAD_TR_B128 (which
//      emits the canonical order) and the other from a plain load, the K labels do not line up and
//      the result is silently wrong. Every kernel in this family stages both operands through the
//      same `stage8` and reads both through `r4d_fp8_frag`, which is what makes that safe.
//   2. A SPARSE path may NOT use this labelling: SWMMAC's index bits are tied to the hardware K
//      groups. Nothing in this family is sparse.
//
// ---- hazards -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A WMMA whose A, B or index overlaps the PREVIOUS WMMA's D needs at least one independent VALU
// instruction in between -- required for correct function, not a perf hint. The compiler inserts it
// for these intrinsics. Feeding D straight back as C of the same opcode is the fast path and is
// exempt, which is why these kernels keep one long accumulator chain of a single opcode rather than
// mixing WMMA types in the inner loop.
//
// And WMMA does NOT co-issue with VALU on RDNA4, for every opcode. Dequantisation and address math
// inside a wave are serial with its matrix work. That is the whole argument for an fp8 GEMM whose
// inner loop converts nothing: v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_fp8_fp8 issues at 412 TF/s (2.99 cycles), the
// same rate as v_wmma_i32_16x16x16_iu8, and here it is reached because both operands are already
// E4M3 bytes and nothing is unpacked between the LDS read and the mma.

// ---- LDS staging, shared by both fp8a8 instantiations -------------------------------------------
//
// An fp8 fragment is 8 bytes a lane, so the granule is 8 B and a 64 B row holds 8 of them. A
// fragment read is ONE granule column over SIXTEEN CONSECUTIVE ROWS, and the whole question is
// which bank each of those rows lands in.
//
// THE ROW PITCH IS NOT THE TILE WIDTH, and that is the point. LDS has 32 banks of 4 B, so bank =
// (byte address / 4) % 32 and a row pitch of P bytes puts row r at bank (r * P/4) % 32. With the
// tile width itself as the pitch -- 64 or 256, both multiples of 128 B -- that is 16r % 32 or
// 0, so rows 8 apart (or all of them) collide and the read serialises.
//
// An XOR granule swizzle -- `(k >> 3) ^ (row & 7)` -- does not solve it. It
// permutes only WITHIN a row, and a 64 B row holds 8 granules, so it can separate at most 8 rows:
// rows r and r+8 still land together and the sixteen lanes of a fragment read take two bank cycles
// rather than one. Fragment reads are a large share of this kernel's time, so the second cycle is
// not a small cost.
//
// A PADDED PITCH separates all sixteen instead, and needs no permutation at all. P = FK + 8 gives
// P/4 = 18 words at FK = 64, and 18r % 32 over r = 0..15 is
//
//     0 18 4 22 8 26 12 30 16 2 20 6 24 10 28 14
//
// -- sixteen distinct even banks, so the sixteen lanes cover all 32 banks exactly once and the
// read is one bank cycle. At FK = 256 it is 66 words and 66r % 32 = 2r % 32, distinct likewise.
// The pad must be a multiple of 8 to keep the 8 B granule aligned for ds_read_b64; +8 is the
// smallest that works, and a larger pad only costs LDS without separating any better -- +16 is
// four words, and 4r % 32 has period 8, so it collides again.
//
// Cost is 8 B a row of LDS: the prefill tile is 36 KiB a block rather than 32, which leaves room
// for 3 resident blocks a WGP rather than 4. The bank cycle saved outweighs the lost block.
