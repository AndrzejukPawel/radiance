// R4D -- the RDNA4 (gfx1201) kernel library: attention, gated delta net, all-reduce and a skinny
// bf16 GEMM, compiled into one shared object. Plain C ABI: every entry point takes raw device
// pointers and a stream, so a consumer needs no C++ ABI coupling to call one. Nothing on the
// launch paths allocates or synchronises, so any of them can be recorded into a HIP graph.
//
// NAMING. An entry point is
//
//     r4d_<family>_<op>_<geometry it is compiled for>
//
// and the geometry suffix is not decoration: these are specialised kernels, and every dimension in
// the name is a compile-time constant that the entry point REJECTS a mismatch on rather than
// running. `attn_decode_h256_gqa6_fp8kv` runs for head_dim 256 with 6 queries per KV head and an
// fp8-e4m3 paged cache, and for nothing else. A model with a different head size needs a new
// instantiation, which will sit beside this one under its own name; nothing has to be renamed to
// make room for it. Dimensions that are fixed for the whole library, and so discriminate nothing
// between entry points, stay out of the names and are reported by r4d_*_dims() and the kernel
// registry instead: the paged block size (16), the query dtype (bf16 everywhere -- see
// r4d_attn_paged_h256_gqa6.hip) and the target architecture.
//
// SOURCE FILES CARRY THE SAME NAME. A translation unit is named for the entry point it provides,
// geometry included -- r4d_gdn_kkt_solve_k128_c64_bf16.hip holds r4d_gdn_kkt_solve_k128_c64_bf16
// and nothing else. Where one unit provides a family that differs only in a suffix, the file name
// stops at the shared part: r4d_gdn_conv_w4_h128_bf16.hip provides the prep and update pair, and
// r4d_attn_paged_h256_gqa6.hip provides all four paged variants by including the two kernel
// templates that sit beside it under their own names. Only the shared machinery -- r4d_common.h,
// r4d_dt16.h, r4d_gdn_wmma.h -- is named for what it is rather than for a kernel, because it
// provides none.
//
// Where a shape is unsupported the attention and GDN entry points return a negative code; the
// all-reduce and GEMM entry points throw std::runtime_error instead, and the plugin shim in front
// of them wraps the call in R4D_TRY, which turns the throw into an ABI status code. Nothing throws
// across the .so boundary.

// ---- the decomposed sampler chain (r4d_sample_stages_f32.hip) -----------------------------------
//
// docs/OPS.md's eleven ops, one entry point each, as opposed to r4d_sample_chain_f32's fused form.
// Both exist and neither replaces the other: the fused one is right when the order is fixed and is
// what a speculative verify wants; these are what an engine that composes the chain per request
// needs, and they carry the stages the fused one has no room for -- penalties, DRY, a grammar
// bitmask, locally-typical, XTC.
//
// `params` is an array of abi/rad_sample.h's RadSampleParams, one row per sampled
// position.  This unit includes that header rather than restating the struct, so there is nothing
// for a caller to check the two layouts of.  Logits are f32.  A dropped candidate is index -1,
// value -infinity, and the buffers never shrink.
//
// The entry points are r4d_rad_sample_{temp,mask,penalties,dry,argmax,topk,topp,minp,typical,xtc,
// pick,merge_topk}, declared in libr4d/r4d_plugin.h with the plugin ABI's signature.  The
// flattened `(long lg, long params, int M, ...)` launch forms are private to
// r4d_sample_stages_f32.hip -- see the note at the entry points there.
//
// Exact top-k: a radix select over the monotone logit key, a second over the token id to break a
// tie at the threshold by the LOWER id, then a bitonic sort of the survivors -- descending, which
// every later stage assumes.  The optional `pairs` plane is the vocab-parallel path: (u32 global
// id, f32 logit) pairs with vocab_off already added, which is what the all-gather moves and what
// the merge reads.  The merge RE-APPLIES the row's top_k -- each rank ran its own before the
// gather, so the merged set holds up to world_size * k where the request asked for k, and nothing
// downstream narrows again.  At k = 1 that is the difference between an argmax and a draw.
