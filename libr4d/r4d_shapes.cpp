/* r4d_shapes.cpp -- how big is operand i of this op at this geometry, and what may be in it.
 *
 * THE COMPONENT THAT KNOWS AN OPERAND'S EXTENT IS THE ONE THAT READS IT, which is what the
 * `RadShapeFn` hook is for. A tool's other source is the hand-written table in `tools/`, and that
 * table cannot reach the ops that exist only here -- every fp8 fusion, both all-reduce folds, both
 * DFlash2 ops, `attn_dense` and all twelve sampler stages -- so without this hook those are
 * SKIPPED AND COUNTED for want of a recipe. This file is libr4d's side of the hook.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITY FOR EVERY EXTENT BELOW IS THE SHIM, not the prose and not the row table. Each
 * `rad_*` entry point in the libr4d shims unpacks `RadArgs.t[i]` and hands libr4d the
 * extents and pitches; where a shim reads `x->shape[1]` and passes it as `K`, that is what the
 * operand is. A comment naming the shim is on every group, so a reader can check one against
 * the other -- and when a shim's contract changes, that is the file whose neighbour has to move.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN AN OPERAND MATTERS AS MUCH AS HOW BIG IT IS. A token id gathers a row of a codebook,
 * a KV slot indexes n_blocks * block_size positions, a block-table entry indexes n_blocks, and a
 * uniform is in [0, 1); draw any of them from the wrong range and the case tests the kernel's
 * out-of-range handling while the report calls it correctness. `RAD_FILL_INDEX` with an explicit
 * `idx_max` is how each of those is said here, and `RAD_OPD_F_IDX_UNIQUE` marks the one scatter
 * (kv_store's slot mapping) whose duplicates would make the store a race and the comparison a
 * measurement of the scheduler.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DESCRIBE, AND WHY. A decline is a real answer: the caller skips the case
 * and counts it, which is correct, where an invented extent produces a PASS that means nothing.
 * The rows below carry a null `opd_shape` deliberately.
 *
 *   gdn_conv_prep, gdn_conv_update, gdn_kkt_solve, gdn_chunk_scan, gdn_recurrent_update
 *       THE HEAD COUNTS ARE NOT IN THE GEOMETRY. `head_k` and `head_v` are head WIDTHS (128 each);
 *       the number of key heads and value heads is read off the operands by the kernels and named
 *       by no parameter of any of these ops, so `conv_dim = 2*Hk*hk + Hv*hv` -- the leading extent
 *       of nearly every operand -- is not derivable from `p`. tools/opshapes.h reaches them only
 *       because rad-kbench hands it the container's metadata through `ShapeCtx`, which this hook's
 *       signature does not carry. A GDN case run at an invented head ratio is a check of a model
 *       nobody is running. (`gdn_gated_rmsnorm` and `gdn_gated_norm_had_quant_i8` ARE described:
 *       their rows are (token, head) pairs and their widths are parameters.)
 *
 *   attn_dense
 *       No head count either. Its parameters are M, head_dim, gqa, causal and dtype; the vision
 *       kernel reads the head count off `q->shape[1]` and gqa is constrained to 1, so nothing in
 *       the geometry says how many heads a token carries. Picking one would be picking a model.
 *       ref describes it -- it chooses `gqa` query heads against one KV head, which at this row's
 *       gqa == 1 is a single head -- and ref's is the description a correctness check uses anyway,
 *       so the gap this leaves is a benchmark of the vision kernel at a head count nobody runs.
 *
 *   sample_merge_topk
 *       The extents are known and a description would still be a lie. `gathered` is
 *       world_size * n_cand (u32 global id, f32 logit) pairs packed into one WORD-TYPED buffer, so
 *       the value lane is read by BIT PATTERN and no fill domain puts a sensible float there: an
 *       integer draw makes every logit a denormal, and a device that flushes denormals against a
 *       host that does not orders the candidates differently -- which is the failure r4d_selftest's
 *       two-rank all-gather row exists to catch. `world_size` is not in the parameter list either.
 *       ref declines it for the same two reasons, and the two files agreeing on a decline is the
 *       point: a description here would supply the bytes ref refused to. The full argument is at
 *       the gap this leaves in the sampler section below.
 *
 *   gemm_nt_q at every grid but fp8
 *       The weight is a plugin-private fragment stream (R4D_DT_W4_FRAG and friends) whose byte
 *       count comes from `RadLayout::bytes`, and RadOpdDesc has only a dtype and a shape -- so a
 *       description here would be a SECOND source for a number r4d_layout.cpp already owns, and
 *       the two would drift silently the first time a packing changed. The scale planes are worse:
 *       R4D_DT_W4_SZ is a (f16 scale, f16 -(1024+zero)) dword whose meaning no public dtype
 *       carries. The fp8 family is different and IS described -- its weight is the checkpoint's
 *       own E4M3 [N][K] bytes against a bf16 [ceil(N/128)][ceil(K/128)] plane, and the fragment
 *       reordering is a permutation of the same count (r4d_fp8_frag.h: `frag_bytes(N,K) == N*K`).
 *
 *   logits_gemm at fp8
 *       THE DECLARED SHAPE AND THE STORED PLANE DIFFER, and only the container knows. The weight
 *       arrives declared [n_vocab][n_embd] E4M3 while the kernel strides it by
 *       r4d_fp8::lm_row_bytes(n_embd) --
 *       the row's own bf16 scales ride in its tail (r4d_fp8_layout.cpp says why: lm_head is ROW
 *       sharded and a shard has to stay a plain byte range). A tool that allocated the declared
 *       shape would hand the kernel a buffer it reads 1.6% past the end of, on every row. The
 *       bf16 row of the same op is described; this one cannot be, until RadOpdDesc can say
 *       "declared this, stored that".
 *
 * NO TUNED AXIS IS READ HERE, and none needs to be. Every axis this plugin declares -- tile
 * shapes, split counts, wave counts, all-reduce launch geometry -- says how a kernel WALKS its
 * operands, not what it is HANDED. An axis that did change an extent would be read from `p`
 * like any other parameter, because the core appends the chosen point to the same list.
 *
 * Pure host code: no r4d.h, no HIP. It is in the CMake `SOURCES` list beside r4d_rows.cpp and
 * r4d_layout.cpp for the reason that split exists -- the tables a transcription error hides in
 * should compile and be readable on a box with no ROCm.

 * which is what r4d_sample.cpp's `params_ok` checks in words. Its CONTENT is a struct, and the
 * ABI's fill domains describe a buffer -- normals, a sigmoid, a gate cumsum, a triangular mask, an
 * index draw -- so there is no spelling for "fill this like a request".
 *
 * DESCRIBED AS f32, WHICH IS A CHOICE ABOUT CONTENT AND NOT ABOUT SIZE, and it is the same choice
 * ref_shapes.cpp makes for the same operand -- the two files have to agree here, because whichever
 * of them a tool asks, BOTH implementations are then handed those bytes. The struct is eleven
 * floats and nine int32s. Drawn as f32 normals every float field -- temp, top_p, min_p,
 * typical_p, the penalties, the two XTC values -- lands in a plausible range, so a third to a half
 * of the rows fall inside the interval that makes their stage do work and the rest are the
 * identity: which is the mix a real batch has.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT REACH, said plainly rather than left for someone to discover from a PASS. The
 * INTEGER fields come out as the bit patterns of those same normals, so `hist_off`, `hist_len` and
 * `mask_row` are enormous -- and every stage clamps them, which is why this is safe on a device
 * and also why it is weak:
 *
 *     sample_penalties   ho is clamped to hmax, hl to hmax - ho, and `hl <= 0` returns
 *     sample_dry         the same clamp, then `hl <= allowed` returns
 *     sample_mask        `mask_row >= mask_rows` returns before a word of the plane is read
 *
 * `flags` is a bit pattern too, so roughly half the rows carry RAD_SP_GREEDY, and every candidate
 * stage -- top-k, the narrowing stages, the merge, the pick -- treats those as having no
 * candidates. Both implementations do, so the comparison holds; it covers the other half.
 *
 * A pass on those three says the plumbing agrees, not that the arithmetic does. The alternative --
 * a word-typed draw, or the all-zero row -- is worse in both directions: it makes every float
 * field a denormal or a NaN and `1 / temp` an infinity, or it makes every stage the identity.
 *
 * u32 IS NEVER USED for this or any other word-typed operand here, and that is not taste:
 * tools/opshapes.cpp's `rad_widen` and `rad_narrow` have no RAD_U32 case, so a u32 operand is
 * FILLED as zeroes and COMPARED as zeroes -- a vacuous pass, which is worse than a skip. i32 is
 * the same four bytes and is read. */
