/* r4d_rows.cpp -- the libr4d row table, and the op schemas that go with it.
 *
 * THIS IS THE TABLE -- the single declaration of what libr4d can serve. A KERNEL MISSING FROM THIS
 * FILE IS INVISIBLE to every caller that asks rather than remembers, and a second table beside it
 * drifts from it, so there is exactly one.
 *
 * A row's constraints are the ENTRY POINT'S rules, restated here; each row says where its band
 * came from, which is the question a reader of one of these rows actually has. Three things do not
 * line up one-to-one with the kernel side's own spelling, and each is marked at the row that does
 * it:
 *
 *   1. KEY NAMES. The kernel library's select() has its own parameter vocabulary; radiance's op
 *      schemas are docs/OPS.md's, because that is what an architecture plugin writes and what
 *      `libref` has to implement. Where the two differ the PREDICATE and its VALUE are the
 *      kernel's exactly and only the key is renamed, with the kernel-side key named in a comment.
 *      `K` -> `n` in the quantiser family, `had` -> `group` for the rotation width, and
 *      `q_dtype`/`kv_dtype` -> `dtype` for the dense vision kernel are the whole list.
 *
 *   2. ORDER IS `priority`, not position. Preference between two rows that both match is expressed
 *      by the R4D_PRIO_* constants, each of which names the kernel-side ordering it preserves
 *      (r4d_plugin.h).
 *
 *   3. ROWS WHOSE BAND COMES FROM THE ENTRY POINT ITSELF -- the tiled and prefill W4A8/W8A8 GEMMs,
 *      the asymmetric grids, `quant_act_i8_asum`, `gemm_w8a8_nt_m64`. Their constraints are read
 *      off the entry point's own rejection tests and its header prose rather than off a
 *      kernel-side registry row, and every one of them says so.
 *
 * Every row is RAD_DOMAIN_DEVICE. libr4d is a gfx1201 kernel library; there is no host arm of any
 * of this, and claiming one would tell the placement planner that a host execution site exists
 * where it does not.

/* ------------------------------------------- the small model ops and the sampler chain -------
 *
 * A constraint is a NECESSARY condition on the GEOMETRY (spec §2.1), and these ops have almost
 * none: there is nothing to specialise an elementwise add on and nothing a norm rejects. What the
 * kernels do require is the activation width -- they read through a uint16_t, and an f32 operand
 * would be read as two bf16 halves and produce plausible garbage -- so `dtype` is the row, and the
 * shims check the operands' own dtypes per call because a parameter is not a promise about a
 * tensor.
 *
 * kv_store carries `block_size >= 1` for the reason ref's does: the key stays RAD_REQUIRED there,
 * so the predicate admits every value and refuses only a query that does not name one. The paged
 * block size itself is derived from the resolved ATTENTION kernel (spec §7.2), which answers 16.
 *
 * The sampler rows constrain only the extent, and only so that a row with no predicate at all
 * cannot match a query that forgot to say what it wanted -- the same reasoning cSampleChain gives.
 * n_cand is bounded because the top-k's bitonic sort runs in LDS over a power-of-two padding. */

/* 128 IS THE SCALE BLOCK AND IT IS THE WHOLE CONSTRAINT. What makes that worth explaining is its
 * interaction with the layout: r4d_rad_layout_fp8_logits stores a vocabulary row as `n_embd` codes
 * followed by its own scales, and the kernel reads sixteen codes at a time through a uint4, so the
 * row stride has to be a multiple of 16. With K = 128j the used width is 130j, and 130j % 16 == 0
 * reduces to j % 8 == 0 -- K % 1024 == 0 -- so a layout that REFUSED an unaligned stride could
 * only honestly claim 1024 here.
 *
 * A ROW'S CONSTRAINTS HAVE TO BE WHAT ITS LAYOUT CAN DO. Claiming 128 against such a layout claims
 * a band the row cannot serve, and the failure is invisible at any n_embd that happens to be a
 * multiple of 1024 (5120, 2048). At one that is not -- 2560 -- the row satisfies the constraint,
 * wins selection on priority, and then has its layout REFUSED at declare time, with the fallback
 * below it unreachable. That is the band-coverage hazard.
 *
 * SO THE LAYOUT IS THE SIDE THAT WIDENS, NOT THE CONSTRAINT. r4d_fp8_lm.h pads the stored row to
 * 16 bytes -- under 0.3% at K = 2560 and exactly nothing at every K the 1024 rule already admitted
 * -- so the hook serves every multiple of 128 and this row can say so. Which direction to move is
