/* ref_shapes.cpp -- how big is operand i of this op at this geometry, and what may legally be in
 * it. libref's implementation of `RadKernelInfo::opd_shape` (rad_abi.h), for every op this
 * plugin registers.
 *
 * ============================== WHY THIS LIVES HERE ==============================
 *
 * A tool that wants to CALL an op cold -- which a correctness check and a benchmark both do -- has
 * to size its buffers somehow, and an op's schema names its operands and their roles but not their
 * extents. The alternative to this hook is a hand-written table inside `tools/` (opshapes.h), and
 * its own header says why that is the wrong home: it can only describe the ops whoever wrote the
 * table had heard of, it cannot be extended by anyone who does not patch the engine, and it is the
 * one place a tool knows something about an op. The component that knows an operand's extent is the
 * one that reads it. This file is ref answering for the whole conventional vocabulary, so an op
 * that stays inside docs/OPS.md is describable even when the kernel under test is not.
 *
 * ============================== ONE FUNCTION PER ROW, NAMED AFTER THE LAUNCH ==============
 *
 * `RadShapeFn` does not carry the op name -- it gets the resolved parameter list and an operand
 * index and nothing else -- so a single shared function would have to recover the op from a
 * parameter, and no op in this vocabulary carries its own name as one. The alternative is a small
 * per-op function in every registry row, and that is what this file supplies: for every entry point
 * `ref_X` there is a `ref_X_shape` beside it, so ref_registry.cpp's ROW() macro pastes the second
 * from the first (`fn ## _shape`) and no row names it explicitly. The 1:1 naming is load-bearing:
 * adding an op to the registry is one row plus one host implementation plus one shape function
 * whose name the macro already demands, so a new op that forgets to describe itself does not link.
 *
 * ============================== THE COUNT IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED ==============================
 *
 * A description must emit exactly as many operands as the schema declares, and that check is what
 * catches a description that has drifted from the schema it describes -- an op that grows an
 * optional operand and a description that does not follow leave the op silently skipped by a tool
 * whose whole job is to say what was checked. Padding with a guess would hide the drift behind a
 * number that looks like a result.
 *
 * The hook is called one operand at a time, so the property has to be rebuilt: every function below
 * fills a small local array with the WHOLE operand list and then hands out the one that was asked
 * for, and `Opd::finish` compares the length against `RadOpSchema::n_operands` read out of this
 * plugin's own schema table. A mismatch returns RAD_E_SHAPE and not RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED,
 * deliberately: RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED is "this geometry does not carry what the op needs" and is a
 * correct answer a caller skips and counts, while a count mismatch is a BUG in this file or in the
 * schema and deserves a distinguishable status.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS IN AN OPERAND ==============================
 *
 * The fill domain matters as much as the extent (rad_abi.h's own comment says the same at length):
 *
 *   * A gated-delta-net `g` is an intra-chunk cumulative sum of log-decays: non-increasing and
 *     never positive. The scan forms e^{g_i - g_j} with j <= i, which is <= 1 ONLY because g is
 *     monotone; handed normals the oracle overflows to 2e38 while the kernel does something else,
 *     and the comparison then measures the test rather than the kernel.
 *   * `beta` is a sigmoid output and lives in (0, 1). `A` is a chunk's triangular inverse and is
 *     zero above the diagonal within a chunk -- a dense random A puts two implementations on
 *     opposite sides of a convention (whether the strictly-upper part is read at all) that they
 *     never disagree about on a real one.
 *   * An index operand's RANGE is part of its meaning. A KV slot indexes n_blocks * block_size
 *     positions and a block-table entry indexes n_blocks, and neither is any operand's dim 0;
 *     drawing either from the wrong range tests the kernel's out-of-range handling and calls the
 *     result correctness.
 *   * A SCATTER destination has to be unique. Two tokens drawn onto one slot make the store a race
 *     and two implementations resolve it differently -- ref runs the token loop under OpenMP and a
 *     device kernel runs a workgroup a token -- so the comparison would measure the scheduler. A
 *     read-side index (a gather row, a block-table entry) may repeat and does.
 *   * `seqused` is a CONSTANT and not a draw. A random context length shorter than the query makes
 *     a causal attention read a prefix that does not exist, which both implementations would then
 *     agree about while neither computed what the model asks for.
 *   * An OPTIONAL operand a description deliberately does not pass still needs an entry -- the
 *     count check above is what catches drift -- so absence has a spelling, and a null
 *     RadTensor.data is what the ABI already means by it.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT ASSUME ==============================
 *
 * A kernel plugin links rad_abi and NOTHING ELSE (libref/CMakeLists.txt), so anything of core's
 * that is not in a header is unreachable: RAD_DEBUG is core's, and ref_common.h makes that trade.
 *
 * WHAT IS REACHABLE IS MORE THAN THE LINK RULE SUGGESTS. `rad_dtype_parse` and `rad_dtype_bytes`
 * are `static inline` in rad_types.h and `rad_param_*` in rad_plugin.h -- header-only, which is
 * the whole point of a header-only ABI -- so they compile into the plugin like any other inline.
 * The rule is: reach for the ABI's version first, and write a local one only where the ABI
 * genuinely has no answer. `gi` below is the one such place, and it says why.
 *
 * `rad_kernel_schema_count` / `rad_kernel_schema_at` ARE this plugin's own exports, defined in
 * ref_registry.cpp beside the table they read, so the count check costs no coupling at all.

 *
 * IT IS DESCRIBED AS f32, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE CHOICE ABOUT CONTENT rather than about size.
 * The struct is eleven floats and nine int32s, and the ABI's fill domains describe a BUFFER and
 * not a struct, so there is no spelling for "fill this like a request". Drawn as f32 normals every
 * float field -- temp, top_p, min_p, typical_p, the three penalties, the two XTC values -- lands in
 * a plausible range, and a third to a half of the rows land inside the interval that makes their
 * stage do work (temp > 0, 0 < top_p < 1, and so on), so `sample_temp`, `sample_topp`,

 * on others, which is the mix a real batch has.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT REACH, said plainly rather than left for someone to discover: the INTEGER fields
 * come out as the bit patterns of those same normals, so `hist_off`, `hist_len` and `mask_row` are
 * enormous, every op clamps them, and `sample_penalties`, `sample_dry` and `sample_mask` therefore
 * take their "nothing to do for this row" branch. A pass on those three says the plumbing agrees,
 * not that the arithmetic does. `flags` is a bit pattern as well, so roughly half the rows carry
 * RAD_SP_GREEDY and every candidate stage treats them as having no candidates -- consistently in
 * both implementations, so the comparison covers the other half. The alternative -- a word-typed
 * draw -- is worse in both directions: it makes every float field a denormal or a NaN, and
 * `1 / temp` an infinity.
 *
 * u32 would also be invisible to the tools for a second reason: opshapes.cpp's rad_widen has no
 * RAD_U32 case, so a u32 operand is compared as zeroes and every case passes vacuously. Every
 * word-typed operand this file describes is therefore i32. */
