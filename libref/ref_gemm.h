/* ref_gemm.h -- how libref reads a matrix operand and its scale stream.
 *
 * Shared by the dense GEMM and the mixture-of-experts GEMM, which need the same three answers:
 * where row `r` of an operand begins, what the scale of a (row, k) pair is, and what a block-
 * scaled grid looks like against the operand it scales. A grouped GEMM is a GEMM per row against
 * a different weight, so it needs exactly the machinery the dense one has and nothing else; a
 * second copy of `make_scales` in ref_moe.cpp would be a second place for the rblk rule to be
 * wrong, and the rblk rule is what makes this reference usable as an oracle for a block-scaled
 * fp8 checkpoint.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure reading of a RadTensor. No op, no dispatch, no allocation.

 * A quantised operand's scales are a separate SoA stream (spec §4.1), shaped [rows, groups] with
 * the group index fastest, or [rows] for one scale per row. The group SIZE is derived from the
 * stream's own extent rather than trusted from the parameter: a `group` that disagrees with the
 * scale tensor is the kind of mismatch that produces plausible wrong numbers, and deriving it
 * makes the disagreement structurally impossible.
 *
 * A BLOCK-SCALED grid is the same stream with fewer rows than the operand. DeepSeek-style fp8 --
 * which is what Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 and every other `weight_block_size: [128, 128]` checkpoint ships --
 * stores one scale per 128x128 TILE, so `weight_scale_inv` is [ceil(N/128)][ceil(K/128)] against an
 * [N][K] weight. `rblk` is how many operand rows share a scale row; it is 1 for every per-row grid,
 * which is every other format in this project, so the division below costs those nothing.
 *
 * Without it this reference reads a 17408-row weight's 136-row scale plane as if it had 17408 rows
 * and lands on `groups = 0`, which is not a diagnosable failure -- it is a plausible wrong number,
 * and it makes ref useless as the oracle for exactly the format the production models are in. */

 * to move one fp8 code, and a fused op being byte-identical to the pair it replaces is the whole
 * claim such a fold rests on. Every caller goes through here so that there is one order.
 *
 * The loads go through `ld_dt` rather than `Cvt<DT>` so that one function serves every dtype pair.
 * The two return the same float for every dtype, so a caller that dispatches on the type at
