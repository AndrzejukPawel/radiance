/* ref_registry.cpp -- what libref contains, in the two forms the core reads it in.
 *
 * THE SCHEMAS COME FIRST, and they are the authoritative copy of the conventional op vocabulary.
 * docs/OPS.md is their prose form (spec §17): op names are free strings and the core never learns
 * one, but ref cannot implement an op it has never heard of, so an architecture plugin that stays
 * inside this table is guaranteed to run somewhere and one that invents an op has no fallback and
 * no oracle for it. Adding a row here plus a host implementation beside it is the whole procedure
 * for adding an op; no core file changes.
 *
 * The first plugin in hierarchy order to declare an op FIXES its schema, and ref sits last, so in
 * practice a faster plugin's schema wins and ref's has to agree with it. Since arguments are
 * positional, two disagreeing schemas would make the same call mean different things depending on
 * which plugin won selection -- silent numerical garbage rather than a diagnosable failure (spec
 * §2.3). Every operand order below is therefore the one docs/OPS.md prints, in the order it prints
 * it, and the deviations are marked in the doc string of the row that deviates.
 *
 * THE KERNEL ROWS ARE DELIBERATELY UNCONSTRAINED. libr4d's rows state their geometry twice -- prose
 * and predicates -- because they are specialised and reject what they were not compiled for. These
 * are the opposite: every extent is read off the operands at launch, so there is nothing to
 * predicate on, and REF MUST MATCH ANYTHING because that is what "runs somewhere" means. The one
 * exception is structural rather than performance-related: kv_store has to be TOLD the paged block
 * size to walk the cache, so it carries `block_size >= 1`, which admits every value and refuses
 * only a query that does not name it (an absent key fails a constraint -- rad_util.cpp's
 * constraint_holds). attn_paged carries the same row, but there
 * `block_size` is RAD_DERIVED and a constraint on a derived key is skipped during matching, so it
 * decides nothing; ref reads the block size off the cache tensor instead.
 *
 * A CONSEQUENCE WORTH NAMING: spec §7.2 has the block manager read the KV block size off the
 * resolved attention kernel's constraints. libr4d answers `block_size == 16`; ref answers "any",
 * which is not a number. A core that resolves attention to ref alone therefore has to pick, and
 * 16 is the value the rest of the project is built around.
 *
 * Everything is domain HOST at priority 0. libref is portable host code, so host is the only
 * domain it declares; a device-side reference would be a second row, not a change to this one.
