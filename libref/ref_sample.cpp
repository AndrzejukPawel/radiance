/* ref_sample.cpp -- the sampler ops.
 *
 * Every sampler in this engine is a KERNEL and not a host lift: at a 151K vocab and batch 256 the
 * logits are ~77 MiB a step, and moving that across the link to run a host chain costs both the
 * bandwidth and a synchronisation, on the step path, at exactly the concurrency the engine exists
 * to serve (spec §13). llama.cpp's chain is kept as a host reference in core/sample/, and THIS is
 * the second implementation of the same arithmetic -- the two are deliberately independent, so
 * that comparing them says something.
 *
 * ============================== EVERY SCALAR IS PER ROW ==============================
 *
 * `rep`, `freq`, `pres`, `k` and `p` cannot be op PARAMETERS. A parameter is geometry: the selector
 * matches constraints against it and freezes it at declare (spec §2.2), so two requests in one
 * batch with different top_p would be two different resolutions of one op. A deployment would have
 * exactly one top_p, which is not a sampler.
 *
 * So they arrive as DATA, in a `params` operand of RadSampleParams rows -- one per sampled
 * position, uploaded once a step (abi/rad_sample.h). That is the schema core/sample/sampler.h
 * issues against, and the one every op below reads its scalars from.
 *
 * `seed` and `pos` are fields of the row for the same reason, rather than two more operands of
 * `sample_pick`.
 *
 * ============================== THE CANDIDATE SET ==============================
 *
 * `sample_topk` produces a fixed-width candidate set and the narrowing stages work IN PLACE. The
 * tensors do not shrink, so a dropped candidate has to be expressible, and the convention is:
 * index -1, value -infinity. Kept candidates stay where they are, in descending order, so a later
 * stage can stop at the first -1 or skip the holes -- both work, and `sample_pick` skips.
 *
 * `cand_val` carries LOGITS, not probabilities. Each narrowing stage takes its own softmax over
 * the candidate set, which is what llama.cpp does and what keeps the stages composable in any
 * order.
 *
 * A ROW'S OWN top_k MAY BE NARROWER THAN THE BUFFER. The candidate width is a deployment bound
 * chosen at declare; a request asking for top_k 40 out of a 1024-wide buffer gets 40 candidates
 * and 984 holes, which every later stage already knows how to skip.
 *
 * A GREEDY ROW (RAD_SP_GREEDY) HAS NO CANDIDATES. Its token is sample_argmax's, and in a batch
 * that mixes greedy and sampled rows every stage runs over every row -- so top-k and the merge
 * write it an empty set, the narrowing stages leave it alone, and the pick does not touch its
 * token. A pick that ignored the flag would replace the argmax with a draw.

 *

 *
 * Only lengths at or above `allowed_length` count, so ordinary repetition of short n-grams is
 * untouched, and a token that is itself a whole sequence breaker is never penalised -- it is what
 * ends the repetition. Both breaker facts come from the host, which is the side with the
 * vocabulary: the row's `dry_rep_limit` (0 for none) and the optional `breakers` plane, one byte
 * per history position, nonzero where that position's token is a single-token breaker.
 *
 * The penalty is multiplier * base^e by repeated multiplication, stopping short of overflow, so
 * every implementation of this op computes the same float; llama.cpp clamps the exponent to the
