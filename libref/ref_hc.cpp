/* ref_hc.cpp -- the GATED RESIDUAL, which is Qwen4-Exp's replacement for a pre-norm and a
 * residual add.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT IS ==============================
 *
 * The residual stream is `hc` times as wide as the model: hidden_size 2560 at hc_count 4 is a
 * 10240-wide stream carried through every layer, entered as four identical copies of the
 * embedding and collapsed once at the end. Every block reads a 2560 mix of the four and writes
 * its output back into all four, and BOTH the read's mix and the write's per-stream gain are
 * data-dependent -- which is what "gated" means here and what makes this a pair of ops rather
 * than a norm.
 *
 *   hc_read    N       = grouped_rmsnorm(h)              one rsqrt per 2560 stream, one gain of
 *                                                        10240 over all four, `1 + w`
 *              g       = sigmoid(W_up @ silu(W_down @ N / hc))
 *              x       = mean_over_streams(g * N)        the block's 2560 input
 *              inj[s]  = 2 * sigmoid(W_inj[s] . N / hc)  four scalars in (0, 2)
 *   hc_write   h[s]   += inj[s] * y                      for each stream s
 *
 * THE WRITE READS THE UNNORMED `h`, NOT `N`. The reference is `hyper_input + injection` where
 * `hyper_input` is the argument the read received, so the normalisation is consumed entirely by
 * the block input and the gate and never enters the stream. Writing back into `N` instead would
 * re-normalise the residual on every one of the 96 connections, which diverges within a few
 * layers and is the one mistake this pair can make that still produces fluent text.
 *
 * THE MIX IS A MEAN, NOT A SUM. `.mean(dim=-2)` over the hc dimension -- so the divide by hc
 * happens here AND, separately, inside both gate arguments (`/ self.hc_count` before the silu and
 * before the inject sigmoid). Three divisions by 4, all of them in the reference, none of them
 * derivable from the others.
 *
 * ============================== WHY THE QUANTISER IS IN THE READ ==============================
 *
 * `q` and `s` are OPTIONAL outputs. Present, the read also emits the fp8 block-scaled form of `x`
 * that the following projection's GEMM wants, which is what keeps a gated-residual model at the
 * same launch count as a pre-norm one: every launch costs a fixed floor whatever it computes, and a
 * model with 96 connections cannot afford a separate quantise op at each. Absent, `x` is bf16 and the
 * caller quantises it itself -- which is what the final mixer does, because its consumer is the
 * lm_head and that is bf16.
 *
 * IT QUANTISES WHAT WAS WRITTEN. `x` is narrowed to its own dtype first and the codes are taken
 * from the narrowed value, not from the f32 accumulator, because that is what a fused kernel
 * necessarily does and the two have to agree bit for bit -- the same epilogue-fold rule the GDN
 * out-projection's quantiser follows (libref/ref_gdn.cpp).
 *
 * `rq` and `rs` are the same argument one consumer further: had_quant_act_fp8 of the stored `x`,
 * for an expert plane stored with a 128-wide Hadamard, whose block would otherwise run that
 * quantiser as a launch of its own.

 *
 * THE MULTI-TOKEN-PREDICTION HEAD'S ENTRY, for a model whose residual stream is `hc` wide.
 *
 * A pre-norm MTP head (Qwen3.5, Qwen3-Next, DeepSeek-V3) joins the trunk's hidden state and the
 * next token's embedding with ONE `fc` over their concatenation, and arch/common/rad_block_mtp_fp8.h
 * runs that as two rmsnorms into the two halves of one buffer and a single gemm_nt. Qwen4-Exp's
 * head cannot: its hidden state is the WIDE stream and the checkpoint carries TWO square matrices,
 *
 *     mtp.fc_hidden.weight        [n, n]        mtp.pre_fc_norm_hidden.weight       [hc * n]
 *     mtp.fc_embedding.weight     [n, n]        mtp.pre_fc_norm_embedding.weight    [n]
 *
 * so the hidden half is `fc_h` applied to EACH of the hc sub-streams -- the reference's own
 * `.unflatten(-1, (hc_count, hidden_size))` idiom, which is how every other 10240-wide tensor in
 * this architecture is handled -- and the embedding half is one 2560-wide product added into all
 * hc of them, which is the same broadcast the trunk enters the stream with (`hidden_states.repeat`).
 *
 *     rs_e      = rsqrt(mean(e^2) + eps)
 *     ne[j]     = e[j] * rs_e * (w_e[j] + wadd)
 *     fe[i]     = sum_j fc_e[i][j] * ne[j]
 *     rs[k]     = rsqrt(mean(h[k*n .. k*n+n)^2) + eps)          -- `ngroup` == hc
 *     nh[k][j]  = h[k*n+j] * rs[k] * (w_h[k*n+j] + wadd)
 *     x[k*n+i]  = sum_j fc_h[i][j] * nh[k][j] + fe[i]
 *
 * IT IS ONE OP AND NOT SIX because every intermediate above is a DIFFERENT VIEW of the same bytes
 * and this ABI has no reinterpreting view: `nh` is [M*hc, n] to the GEMM and [M, hc*n] to the norm,
 * and core/runtime/issue.cpp narrows dim 0 or the last dimension with every stride left alone --
 * which is the right rule and makes a row-pitch change inexpressible. Spelling the entry as one op
 * is what lets the wide buffers stay wide. It is also six launches off a draft round, and a draft
 * round is the latency this head exists to hide.
 *
 * `ngroup` IS THE ONE THING THE CHECKPOINT DOES NOT SAY. A [hc * n] gain fits both a grouped norm
 * (hc rsqrts, one per sub-stream -- what Qwen4ExpTextGatedResidual does at every one of its 97
 * connections) and a flat one (a single rsqrt over the whole wide row). Both are self-consistent
 * and no per-op oracle can tell them apart, exactly as rad_block_mtp_fp8.h's concat order cannot
 * be told apart -- and it has the same cheap empirical answer, the draft acceptance rate. `ngroup`
 * carries the choice so it is asked once, at declare, instead of being compiled in.
