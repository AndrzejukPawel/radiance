/* opshapes.h -- how big is operand i of this op, given its resolved geometry.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE THE TOOLS KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT AN OP, AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO.
 *
 * An op's schema names its operands and their roles but not their extents, and the extents are
 * not derivable from the parameters in general -- the run phase supplies them at issue. So a tool
 * that wants to CALL an op cold, which rad-kbench and rad-tune both do, has to size its buffers
 * somehow, and the honest options are a table here or a hook on RadKernelInfo.
 *
 * The hook is the better answer: a `RadShapeFn` beside RadLayoutFn, asking the kernel to describe
 * operand i for a geometry (see rad_operand_shapes_hook below). libref implements every op in the
 * conventional vocabulary, so once ref supplies the hook for all of them this file can go away.
 * Until then this covers the vocabulary in docs/OPS.md whose shapes follow from its
 * parameters, and every op it does not cover is SKIPPED AND COUNTED by its caller rather than
 * guessed at -- a tool that invents an extent tests the kernel's bounds handling and calls the
 * result correctness.
 *
 * Shared by rad-kbench and rad-tune so the two cannot disagree about what shape a case is; a
 * tuning measurement taken at a different extent from the correctness check is a measurement of
 * something else.

 * only ever describe the ops whoever wrote the table had heard of. Everything below this function
 * is the fallback for a plugin that does not implement the hook.
 *
 * WHICH kernel to ask is a real choice and it is the caller's:
 *
 *   - A CORRECTNESS check wants the ORACLE's description. The two implementations have to be
 *     handed the same bytes for the comparison to mean anything, and where they disagree about an
 *     extent the reference semantics are the ones that define the op.
 *   - A BENCHMARK wants the KERNEL UNDER TEST's own. A device-only fusion has no oracle at all --
 *     which is why a large part of an accelerated library is reachable only this way -- and timing
 *     one still needs buffers.
 *
 * So this takes the RadKernelInfo to ask rather than deciding, and returns RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED if
 * that kernel has no hook or declines the geometry. A decline is a real answer and the caller
 * SKIPS AND COUNTS it; only a caller that invents an extent is wrong, because it then tests the
