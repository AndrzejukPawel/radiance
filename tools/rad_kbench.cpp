/* rad-kbench -- falsify every resolved kernel against libref, per op, on the real container.
 *
 * This is the most important tool in the project. A from-scratch engine whose kernels cannot be
 * individually falsified is a project that ends with fluent wrong output and no way to bisect it
 * (spec §17): every component tests clean, the whole emits degenerate text, and there is nowhere
 * to look.
 *
 * The properties that make a per-kernel check worth trusting:
 *
 *   THE ARTIFACT, NOT A SYNTHETIC.   Weight operands come from the .rad, in the layout the
 *   resolved kernel asked for and rad-convert produced. A test that quantises in-process shares
 *   the quantiser, the layout and the geometry with the code under test and therefore proves too
 *   little.
 *
 *   FORMAT LATCHED FROM THE ARTIFACT.  The geometry every op is checked at comes from the
 *   container's metadata through the same declare phase the engine runs, not from a literal here.
 *
 *   SKIP RATHER THAN FAIL when a kernel legitimately does not serve a case, and say which.
 *
 *   PER-(OP, DTYPE) TOLERANCES. One threshold cannot govern 5-bit codebook experts, fp8 dense and
 *   bf16 dense alike: it is either loose enough to pass the first or tight enough to test the
 *   last, never both.
 *
 *   NON-FINITE IS A FAILURE, CHECKED FIRST.  A threshold written `rel > tol || rel < 0` is FALSE
 *   for NaN, so a NaN error passes such a check silently. Here the finiteness pattern of both
 *   sides is compared before any norm is computed.
 *
 *   PER-CASE SEEDS.  Drawing every input from one global generator makes what a case sees depend
 *   on which cases ran before it, so two runs with different flags are not comparable. Here the
 *   seed is a hash of (op, band, domain, operand), so a case is reproducible independently of
 *   every other case and of the flags.

 *
 * ONE DOCUMENT, EVERY LIBRARY, THREE QUESTIONS.
 *
 * A kernel library is worth having only if it is correct, complete enough to serve the graph and
 * faster than what it replaces -- and those three are not separable in practice. A library that
 * wins every benchmark on the eight ops it implements and falls back to the reference for the
 * ninth is slower end to end than one that is uniformly mediocre, and a per-op speed table alone
 * says the opposite. So the three are sections of ONE report out of ONE run, and the summary at
 * the top carries all three for each library side by side.
 *
 * ONE PASS, BOTH MEASUREMENTS. A correctness check and a benchmark set up exactly the same thing
 * -- the declared graph, the resolved kernel, the real container's weights in the layout that
 * kernel asked for, operands sized and filled per the op's own description -- and then one of
 * them compares the answer and the other times it. Doing that twice in two tools means two
 * chances for the two setups to differ, and a timing taken at a different extent from the
 * correctness check is a timing of something else.
 *
 * WHAT THE TIMING IS AND IS NOT. It is `iters` back-to-back launches on ONE set of operands,
 * median of `reps`, with the stream synced inside the timed region -- submission alone measures
 * the queue, not the kernel. Because the operands are reused, a weight small enough to sit in the
 * last-level cache is READ FROM CACHE on every launch after the first, so the derived GB/s is an
 * upper bound and not a serving number -- it can be around twice what the same kernel sustains in
 * a real step. Rotating buffers between launches is what defeats that; this tool does not, and
 * the report says so at the top of the table rather than in a footnote. These numbers rank
 * kernels against each other at real model shapes; they do not size a roofline.

         * its own query, so without a depth sweep a decode of 10 query rows is checked against 10
         * tokens of KV and `attn_paged` is never checked at any real depth. That is the dimension
         * the paged kernel's block table, its split-K over KV and its window masking all live on,
         * and where a bug costs whole percentage points of decode throughput -- a rebased block
         * table leaving stale slots past the window is the shape of it. Depth is swept for any op
