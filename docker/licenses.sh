# FILE... are the paths, in the build image, of every file copied into ROOT from outside the
# radiance install: the shared libraries, comgr, busybox, the GPU name table. Each is traced to the
# package that installed it, or to the FFmpeg stage's /opt/ffmpeg. Every package's license files
# are copied to ROOT/usr/share/doc/<package>/, the license texts Debian's copyright files refer to
# go to ROOT/usr/share/common-licenses/, and ROOT/usr/share/doc/THIRD-PARTY lists each component
# with its version, its license files and where its source is. A file that no package owns, or a
# package that ships no license file, stops the build: the image would hold software whose license
# is not recorded.
