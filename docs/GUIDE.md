# Radiance — user guide

Radiance is an inference server: it loads a model and answers OpenAI-compatible HTTP requests.
This guide takes you from an empty machine to a running server, and then through operating one.

There is no Python anywhere — not in the engine, not in the tools, not in the build. Everything
below is C++, CMake and shell.

## 0. The whole thing in five commands

```sh
./build.sh                                          # build and test
export RADIANCE_HOME=$PWD/build/radiance_home

scripts/hfget.sh Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next ~/ckpt     # get a checkpoint
build/bin/rad-convert ~/ckpt -o ~/m.rad \
    --recipe data/recipes/qwen4exp-w4.recipe        # quantise it into a container
build/bin/radiance --model ~/m.rad --port 8000      # serve it
```

A checkpoint served at its own precision needs no container at all: `radiance --model ~/ckpt`
reads it as it stands (§3.4).

Then:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":50}' \
  | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'
```

and open `http://localhost:8000/` for the dashboard. Everything below is the detail behind those
five lines.

---

## 1. Install

**Or skip this section and run the container image**: `docker/build.sh` builds the engine inside
the ROCm toolchain image, tests it and produces an image that needs only Docker and the `amdgpu`
driver on the host. [`DOCKER.md`](DOCKER.md) covers it, along with ready compose files per model.

### 1.1 What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **Required** | Linux, a C++20 compiler, CMake 3.21+, Ninja, pthreads |
| **Optional** | ROCm with `hipcc`, for AMD device kernels. Without it you get the host backend. Set `ROCM_PATH` if it is not at `/opt/rocm` |
| **Optional** | OpenMP, used by the host kernel libraries if present |
| **For the shell harnesses** | `curl` and `jq` |

Everything else is vendored in `vendor/` — the HTTP server, the JSON library and the llama.cpp
lifts. There is nothing to `apt install` beyond a toolchain.

**A machine with no GPU is a supported configuration.** The host backend is a real implementation,
not a stub: the core, scheduler, planner, tokeniser, server and `libref` all run through it and
the full test suite passes. It is slow, and it will not serve a production model — but it is a
complete development and inspection environment.

### 1.2 Build

```sh
git clone <repo> radiance && cd radiance
./build.sh
```

That configures, builds and runs the tests. It detects your situation: if `hipcc` is present and a
card can be enumerated, device kernels are compiled for that card's architecture; otherwise you
get the host backend.

Options:

```sh
./build.sh -c          # wipe the build directory first
./build.sh --no-hip    # force the host backend even where hipcc exists
./build.sh --debug     # -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
./build.sh --asan      # AddressSanitizer
./build.sh -b mybuild  # build into mybuild/ instead of build/
```

Or drive CMake yourself:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

### 1.3 Check that it works

```sh
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure        # everything (a few minutes)
ctest --test-dir build -LE slow                   # the fast inner loop (~1 s)
ctest --test-dir build -LE gpu                    # skip anything needing a card
```

Three of them are worth knowing by name, because they are the ones that actually check kernels:

- **`kbench` / `kbench_moe`** (label `slow`) replay a recorded fixture — every kernel every loaded
  library supplies, checked against `libref`'s recorded answers on seeded inputs. **No model file is
  needed**, which is what makes this runnable on a build machine. It also regression-tests `libref`
  itself, which a live oracle never can.
- **`r4d_selftest`** (labels `slow`, `gpu`) checks libr4d's fusion claims by `memcmp` against the
  unfused kernels it says it replaces.
- **`ops_doc`** (fast) checks that `docs/OPS.md` still agrees with what the plugins declare. A
  document that is wrong is worse than one that is missing, because it is read instead of the source.

You can also run the kernel check by hand:

```sh
build/bin/rad-kbench --home build/radiance_home --max-cases 1
```

### 1.4 Install to a prefix

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
cmake --build build -j
sudo cmake --install build
```

What lands where:

```
<prefix>/bin/                      radiance, rad-convert, rad-info,
                                   rad-kbench, rad-tune, rad-schemas, rad-tokcheck
<prefix>/include/                  the ABI headers — all a plugin compiles against
<prefix>/lib/cmake/radiance/       the package config, for find_package(radiance)
<prefix>/share/radiance/           $RADIANCE_HOME: kernels/, architectures/, quantizers/, kernels*.rkb
```

### 1.5 `$RADIANCE_HOME`

This is the directory the engine and every tool scan at startup:

```
$RADIANCE_HOME/
  kernels/         kernel libraries       libr4d.so, libref.so, libavx.so, yours.so
  architectures/   architecture plugins   qwen4exp_fp8.so, llama_fp8.so, ...
  quantizers/      quantiser plugins      libquant.so
  kernels.rkb      the recorded kernel fixtures rad-kbench replays (and kernels_moe.rkb)
  tune/            per-machine tuning caches rad-tune writes
```

It defaults to the install prefix's `share/radiance`. Override it with `--radiance-home DIRS` or the
`RADIANCE_HOME` environment variable — a search path: homes separated by `:`, the first winning,
each holding any of the directories above. A directory of your own plugins goes ahead of an
installation's without copying it, and `rad-info --plugins` prints what the path offers:

```sh
RADIANCE_HOME=$HOME/radiance-plugins:/opt/radiance/share/radiance rad-info --plugins
```

**Running from a build tree**, the home is `build/radiance_home` and the plugins are already in it:

```sh
export RADIANCE_HOME=$PWD/build/radiance_home
build/bin/radiance --model m.rad
```

Adding support for a new card means dropping an `.so` into `kernels/` — not forking the engine.
The engine's own device code is built for every AMD GPU family, so one engine binary starts on any
card; a kernel library whose code objects hold nothing for the card is left out of selection when
it loads, and says so. `docs/PLUGIN.md` §10 is a library for a card the engine has never seen.

### 1.6 Building for a card you do not have

Device kernels are compiled for the architectures the machine reports. To target others:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DRAD_GPU_TARGETS='gfx1201;gfx1200'
```

Which of those actually get kernels is decided by the libraries present; each one declares the
architectures it serves and stays out of a build targeting anything else. The engine's own device
code is built for every family's generic target besides, whatever is named here.

---

## 2. Five things to know before you start

**1. A model is a checkpoint served as it stands, or a `.rad` container.** A checkpoint whose
weights are bf16, f16, f32 or block-scaled fp8 is served at that precision straight from its
directory. Anything that needs quantising is quantised once, by `rad-convert` and a recipe, into a
container. A container holds each weight as the planes of its *encoding* — codes, scales, zero
points, a rotation — in one canonical arrangement, plus the tokeniser, the chat template, the
metadata, the recipe it was quantised with and optionally a draft head. No kernel library is named
in either: the kernels rearrange the planes into their own layouts as the model loads, so a kernel
library can change without a reconvert.

**2. Kernels are plugins, and the order matters.** The engine resolves every op in the model
against an ordered list of kernel libraries: first one that matches an op wins. `--kernels
mylib,libref` states that order. With no list, the loader orders what it finds and puts a
library that declares itself a reference implementation last.

Three ship with the tree:

| library | |
|---|---|
| `libr4d` | the device library: AMD RDNA4 (`gfx12xx`). Paged and dense attention, gated delta net, P2P all-reduce, skinny and tiled quantised GEMM, rotate-and-quantise fusions. Built when ROCm is present and the build targets a `gfx12` card |
| `libref` | every op naively and generically. The last-resort fallback **and** the correctness oracle `rad-kbench` measures against |
| `libavx` | the host library: the same vocabulary in hand-written x86 SIMD, dispatched by CPU feature at load. Serves every op placed on the host, the n-gram embedding's gather among them. Built on x86-64 |

A library states the architectures it serves and stays out of a build targeting anything else, so a
tree configured for a card it does not cover still builds and still runs.

**3. Architectures are plugins too.** `arch/<id>/` declares a model family's graph. Six ship:

| plugin | serves |
|---|---|
| `llama_fp8`, `llama_dense_fp8` | LLaMA-shaped decoders — MiniCPM5, Llama 3, anything reporting `model_type: llama` |
| `qwen35_bf16` | Qwen3.5 / 3.6 / 3.8 dense (0.8B–27B), bf16 |
| `qwen35_fp8` | the same, block-scaled fp8 |
| `qwen35moe_fp8` | Qwen3.5 / 3.6 MoE (35B-A3B), 256 experts, 8 a token |
| `qwen4exp_fp8` | Qwen4-Exp / Qwen3.8-Flash-Next — hybrid Gated DeltaNet + gated attention, 512 experts |

**4. Falling back to the reference library is a fatal error, not a warning.** `libref` implements
every op naively and generically. It is the oracle and the last resort. If your model resolves any
op to it, the engine **refuses to start** and names the ops, because serving from it would be
orders of magnitude slow with nothing in the output to say so. That list of ops is exactly the
work a new kernel library has to do. `--debug-accept-reference-kernels` overrides it for bring-up.

**5. Every pool is budgeted explicitly.** There is no profiling pass and no utilisation fraction.
The trade between KV blocks and resident weights is real, workload-dependent and **yours to make**.
An engine that quietly re-optimises the split is an engine whose benchmarks do not reproduce.

---

## 3. Get a model in

### 3.1 Download a checkpoint

```sh
scripts/hfget.sh Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next
```

`curl` and `jq`, nothing else. Re-running resumes: a file whose local size already matches is
skipped and a short one is continued. It also skips duplicate weight formats — if a repo carries
`.safetensors` it will not also pull the `.bin`, the ONNX export and the GGUF.

Set `HF_TOKEN` for a gated or private repo. `HFGET_JOBS` sets concurrency (default 4).

### 3.2 Convert it

```sh
rad-convert ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 -o ~/models/rad/q38-27b-fp8.rad --home $RADIANCE_HOME
```

Input is a `.gguf`, a `.safetensors`, or a directory holding a checkpoint. What happens: the
architecture plugin declares the model's graph and its name map says which checkpoint tensors make
each weight; every op is resolved against the kernel hierarchy and every resolved kernel is asked
whether it reads the encoding each weight will have; then each weight is written once, as its
encoding's planes, and the tokeniser and chat template are baked in.

**A recipe decides what is quantised.** With none, every weight keeps the checkpoint's encoding,
which is right for a bf16 or block-fp8 checkpoint served at its own precision. A model whose served
form needs quantisation work — Flash-Next's four-bit experts, an fp8 head made from a bf16 one —
names it in rules from weight names to quantisers:

```sh
rad-convert ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next -o ~/models/rad/flashnext-w4.rad \
    --recipe data/recipes/qwen4exp-w4.recipe --home $RADIANCE_HOME
```

`qwen4exp-w4.recipe` rounds the experts to nearest and needs nothing but the checkpoint. The
production Flash-Next container, `w4nl64-i8lm.rad`, is built by
`data/recipes/qwen4exp-w4nl64-i8-hc8m.recipe`, whose expert rule is GPTQ against recorded Grams:
it expands `$CALIB` from the environment, so it is run as `CALIB=DIR rad-convert ...` with `DIR`
holding a calibration run's files. The recipe's header and [MOE-W4.md](MOE-W4.md) say what that
directory must hold and how it is recorded.

```
# data/recipes/... -- PATTERN  QUANTISER  OPTIONS; the first match decides
blk.*.ffn_*_exps.*.weight   gptq  codes=i4 group=128 scale=bf16 transform=fwht128 calib=$CALIB
output.weight               rtn   codes=fp8_e4m3 block=128x128 scale=bf16
blk.*.weight                rtn   codes=fp8_e4m3 block=128x128 scale=bf16
```

Every weight it quantises is measured against the source and the worst are printed. The recipe
syntax, the quantisers and their options are in [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md#recipes).

Because it runs the same declare phase the engine does, everything that can refuse has refused by
the time the I/O starts — including a recipe no loaded kernel can serve. On a large checkpoint that
I/O is an hour, so check the plan first:

```sh
rad-convert <checkpoint> -o out.rad --recipe r.recipe --plan-only -v
```

Useful variants:

```sh
# Merge a separate drafter checkpoint (DSpark, DFlash2) into the container
rad-convert $SRC -o out.rad --draft-model ~/models/openbmb/MiniCPM5-2B-DSpark

# Re-quantise some weights and copy the rest from an earlier container
rad-convert $SRC -o new.rad --recipe new.recipe --reuse old.rad
```

The conversions of record live in `scripts/convfn.sh` and `scripts/convdspark.sh`, with their
recipes in `data/recipes/`.

### 3.3 Look at what you built

```sh
rad-info ~/models/rad/flashnext-w4.rad
```

```
flashnext-w4.rad
  format        RAD2, 166.4 GiB, little-endian
  architecture  qwen4exp
  model         Qwen3.8-Flash-Next
  source quant  (none)
  recipe        14 line(s) -- --recipe prints it
  created by    rad-convert ...

  section          offset        bytes    count
  strings             256      1.2 MiB        -
  metadata        1258752      8.4 KiB      214
  ...
```

`rad-info` opens the file read-only and loads no plugins. It lists every weight with its encoding
and what made it — the checkpoint as it stood, or the recipe rule's quantiser and options.

```sh
rad-info --meta m.rad                  # just the metadata table
rad-info --vocab m.rad                 # vocab summary and normaliser chain
rad-info --recipe m.rad                # the recipe it was converted with
rad-info -v m.rad                      # every tensor
```

### 3.4 Or skip the container

```sh
radiance --model ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8
```

`--model` takes a checkpoint directory, a `.safetensors`, an index or a `.gguf`, and serves it at
its own precision. Its `config.json` (or the GGUF header) is the metadata, the `tokenizer.json` and
chat template beside it are the tokeniser, and `generation_config.json` gives the sampling defaults.
The weights are read once, at load, by every relayout worker at once.

**Nothing is quantised at load.** A weight the architecture plugin reads in another encoding than
the checkpoint holds is named at startup, and the remedy is a container with a recipe that says
what it becomes. MiniCPM5-2B is one: OpenBMB ships it in bf16, and `llama_dense_fp8` reads fp8.

What a container has that a checkpoint does not:

| | |
|---|---|
| the file and mapped tiers | a checkpoint is neither grouped nor aligned for them, so every weight must fit VRAM or the host pool, and a weight only a host kernel reads (the n-gram table) cannot be served |
| a merged drafter | `--draft-model` is `rad-convert`'s; a checkpoint serves the draft head it ships, if any |
| a placement profile | worth about a point of expert hit rate |

A GGUF is read when its architecture plugin maps llama.cpp's tensor names; the shipped plugins map
HuggingFace's, so a model of a shipped architecture is converted from its safetensors release.

---

## 4. Serve it

### 4.1 The simplest run

```sh
radiance --model ~/models/rad/flashnext-w4.rad
```

It claims the card (less `--gpu-headroom-mib`, default 96 MiB), splits it between weights and KV
cache, loads, and serves on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. The startup log states every budget before
anything is allocated.

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --port 8100 --host 127.0.0.1
```

### 4.2 Look before you leap

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --debug-graph
```

Prints the entire declared graph — every op, the kernel each one resolved to, and why — then exits
without serving. This is the first thing to run against a new container or a new kernel library.

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --debug-selection    # just the selection table
radiance --model m.rad --debug-placement    # just the placement plan
```

### 4.3 Memory: how the card gets split

The card is split into **resident weights** and the **paged KV pool**. You can state the split
outright:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --vram-weights-mib 24000 --vram-kv-mib 6000
```

or let the engine derive it from the card and tell it only the ratio:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --expert-vs-cache-ratio 0.82
```

`--expert-vs-cache-ratio` is the **weights** share of what is claimed. 0.75 (the default) gives
three quarters to weights and a quarter to KV.

**This flag decides whether multi-turn works, which is more than the split it names.** The KV side
is not only concurrency: prefix caching holds a finished sequence's blocks so the next turn can
reuse them. When the pool cannot hold the *live sessions*, the cache drops prefixes the next turn
wanted and that turn re-prefills its whole context. At long contexts that is two orders of magnitude
of time-to-first-token, bought back for a fraction of a percent of the decode step.

Measured on Qwen3.8-Flash-Next at a 200K context, two ~184K-token sessions, byte-identical text:

| ratio | turn 1 | turn 2 | prefix hit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.87 | 207.4 s | 173.0 s | 0.0% |
| 0.82 | 227.7 s | **3.0 s** | 99.0% |

Same model, same prompts. The only difference is whether the pool could hold both sessions. 57x on
the second turn, paid for with ~10% on the cold first turn and ~1.4% of the decode step — experts
lose 5% of the elastic pool and the MoE GEMM is residency-bound.

The cliff is sharp and it is worth knowing where: at this shape 0.84 is **not** enough (49.7% hit,
one of the two sessions), and watching `kv_util` finds it — between 0.75 and 0.81 of the pool the
hit rate falls from 80.7% to 49.4%.

To size it yourself: work out what a token of context costs across **all** paged groups for your
model (the startup log prints this), multiply by the context you actually serve, multiply by the
sessions you want live at once, and give the KV side at least that.

Worked, on Qwen3.8-Flash-Next: two paged groups share one token axis — `kv_attn` at 26.00 KiB and
`kv_qsa_bkey` at 3.25 KiB per 4-token block — so a token of context costs **7.32 KiB**, and a
200K-token sequence is 1.43 GiB. A prefix-cached session occupies roughly 1.8x its context in pool
tokens, so two live 184K sessions want ~662K pool-tokens. That is the number the KV side has to
clear.

What is claimed is not all of the card. The **activation arena** — scratch for the largest step
the engine may run — is taken off the budget *before* it is split, so it is paid for by both
sides. It grows with `--max-num-batched-tokens`, which is why raising the prefill chunk costs
resident experts (§4.5).

**Most of the arena is lent back while the steps are small.** A decode step is a few dozen rows
of the 2048 a prefill chunk carries, so the engine asks the architecture plugin to declare its
activations again at smaller step sizes (the decode rows rounded up to a power of two and at least
256, then four times that, up to the step budget) and packs each into the bottom of the arena. While the recent steps fit a smaller size, the top of the arena holds expert
weights; the first step that needs more takes it back before it runs — a change of address for
the units there, not a copy. Startup prints what each size lends (`activation arena: lends ...`).
A plugin opts in (`RadArchProbe::shape_probe_ok`); one that does not keeps its whole arena.

Related flags:

```sh
--gpu-headroom-mib 96      # VRAM left unclaimed on every card
--kv-cache-dtype fp8       # halve what a token of context costs (a real quantisation)
--host-pool-mib 8192       # pinned host tier for weights
--weights-disk-tier       # stream what fits neither from the container; needs O_DIRECT
```

**A model larger than the card and the host pool together still serves with
`--weights-disk-tier`** -- and every step is then paced by the drive, which is the trade the flag
names. A routed expert that fits neither VRAM nor the pinned pool lives in the container and
nowhere else; before each routed layer's first expert op, on every pass, the engine reads all of
that layer's on-disk experts into one of two VRAM buffers (a router's picks are not known on the
host, and a prefill chunk routes to nearly all of them anyway). The two buffers come out of the
weight budget -- the plan report's `file buffers` line -- and the reads go through four 32 MiB
pinned windows out of `--host-pool-mib` as long runs of the container, skipping resident experts.
What it is for: serving a checkpoint as it ships to calibrate or compare against, not a
production deployment. The bf16 Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (335 GiB) runs at two cards this way at about
28 s a step, and that step costs the same at one token as at 32K, so give it large prefill steps:

```sh
rad-convert ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next -o flashnext-bf16.rad --max-ctx 4096   # no recipe: bf16
radiance --model flashnext-bf16.rad --tp 2 --placement expert_tiered --weights-disk-tier \
    --host-pool-mib 12288 --deterministic --gpu-headroom-mib 768 \
    --max-num-seqs 32 --max-num-batched-tokens 32768 --num-speculative-tokens 0
```

A production server leaves the flag off, so a budget that does not fit is refused at startup
rather than served from the drive.

**The KV pool is elastic on every run and there is no flag for it.** It holds the blocks it is
actually using plus a buffer it derives — one prefill chunk, or the largest shortfall the
admission path has met in the last few seconds, whichever is larger — and the expert plane grows
into whatever it releases. A pool that held every block it was carved for whether or not a token
was in it would, on a model whose experts do not fit, stream weight over the link for the whole
run to pay for cache nobody is using.

What it leans on is `--gpu-headroom-mib`. That reserve is what the card keeps for allocations
this engine does not make — chief among them a kernel's code object, which HIP loads on the
kernel's *first launch*, not at startup. A deployment whose budget settles *below* its stated
headroom has already spent it, and the slab growing into what is left collides with the first
kernel that has never run: a draft head's, a sampler chain's, whatever the early requests did not
reach. It fails its load and faults inside the HIP runtime, which arrives as a segfault in a
kernel that is correct, on a server that had been serving fine.

Startup measures that shortfall and holds it back on top of the reserve, so a run that did not
quite keep its headroom is safe rather than fatal — but it is costing you the VRAM twice. Raise
`--gpu-headroom-mib` past the number startup names, so the budget resolver sees it and the expert
plane is sized against it instead of trimmed afterwards.

### 4.4 Long context

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --max-model-len 200000 --kv-cache-dtype fp8 \
         --expert-vs-cache-ratio 0.82 --max-num-seqs 8
```

`--max-model-len` does not reserve anything per request — it sets the worst case the pool is sized
against. `0` takes the model's training context.

`--kv-cache-dtype fp8` is an E4M3 cache with per-(sequence, head) descales. It halves what a token
of context costs, which at a production context is most of the pool. It is a real quantisation and
the model computes a slightly different function with it, so it is stated rather than inferred.
Every architecture serves both widths, and the flag sets every attention cache of the deployment —
a drafter's (DSpark, DFlash2) as well as the trunk's. The delta-net state and the QSA indexer's
key tail are recurrent state rather than an attention cache and keep their own widths.

**Many sequences against a long context.** `--max-num-seqs` runs to 32 on every model here, and
what it costs is not context — a sequence holds only the blocks its tokens occupy — but what exists
per sequence whether it is used or not:

- **Recurrent state.** On a hybrid model every sequence owns its delta-net state, and with
  speculation two copies of it. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next keeps 54 MiB a copy on each card, so 32
  sequences take 3.4 GiB of the cache share before a single token is cached. At
  `--expert-vs-cache-ratio 0.82` the attention cache then holds about 116K tokens, less than one
  200K request, and startup warns that a longer one would be refused; 0.78 brings it back, and the
  experts it moves off the card cost single-stream decode about 15%. The 27B in bf16 lands at
  117K the same way. The 27B in FP8 holds 2.8 full-length sessions at 32, the 35B-A3B ten.
- **Block tables.** The step batch's tables are carved for every sequence at the full context.
  They are charged to the VRAM budget (`step staging` in the startup receipt), so they come out of
  the cache share and not out of `--gpu-headroom-mib`.

The startup line `the pool backs N% of the worst case ... M full-length sessions` counts only the
part of the pool that holds context, so M is the number to compare with the sessions you expect
to keep live. With `--tp-wire wht6`, a decode step above the row count startup names is
all-reduced lossily like a prefill chunk, which a busy step reaches: at 8 sequences and depth 3,
Flash-Next's decode steps are already over it.

### 4.5 Prefill speed: the chunk

A long prompt is prefilled in chunks, and `--max-num-batched-tokens` is how big one is. It is the
single biggest lever on time-to-first-token on a mixture-of-experts model, because a chunk sweeps
the whole expert plane once however many tokens are in it — so four times the chunk is a quarter
of the sweeps.

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --max-num-batched-tokens 2048
```

On a 48-layer MoE at 200K context on two cards, prompts of 8K and 24K tokens:

| chunk asked for | 512 | 1024 | **2048** | 4096 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| chunk actually run | 512 | 1024 | **2048** | 2048 |
| prefill | 1750 tok/s | 2200 | **2706** | 2620 |

At full context the same change is the difference between waiting and waiting a lot: a
185,253-token prompt prefills in **91 s at a 2048 chunk against 138 s at 512**.

**The 4096 column is the trap, and the engine warns about it.** On a hybrid model the chunk is
clamped to `--checkpoint-interval` (2048 by default) *before* the token budget, so asking for 4096
runs 2048 chunks and pays for 4096 anyway: the activation arena grows with the budget and is
charged to the VRAM budget *before* it is split between weights and KV, so the expert plane loses
residency for a chunk it never got. Startup prints which of the two bound it:

```
chunk geometry: quantum 64 (attn block ..., state chunk ...), checkpoint interval 2048,
max_tok 4096 -> prefill chunks of at most 2048 (the checkpoint interval, not the budget)
```

Read that line, and `RADIANCE_LOG_STEPS=1` prints the token count of every step if you want to see
it per step.

Raising both — `--max-num-batched-tokens 4096 --checkpoint-interval 4096`, which does run 4096
chunks — does not help either: 2610 tok/s against 2748, because the arena takes
another 239 resident experts (9219 to 8980) and the extra amortisation does not pay for them. On
a model whose prefill is bound by the link carrying non-resident experts, the chunk stops winning
as soon as it starts costing residency.

**It does not cost the requests already running.** A longer chunk holds the device longer per
step, so a decode step queued behind one waits longer — but the prefill it is queued behind
finishes sooner, and that is the larger term. Four decoders with a long prompt landing beside
them finished in 29.5 s at a 2048 chunk against 31.9 s at 512.

**And check it did not cost you the prefix cache.** The arena it grows is charged before the
split (§4.3), so the KV pool shrinks a little — here 516,864 → 499,920 pool tokens, 3.3% — and
§4.3's cliff is sharp enough that 3% is worth confirming rather than assuming. On this shape it
costs nothing: two ~180K sessions, first turns back to back, then the first session's second turn.

| chunk | session A turn 1 | session B turn 1 | A turn 2 | cached | evictions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 512 | 137.7 s | 130.0 s | 1.42 s | 178,176 of 179,585 | 0 |
| 2048 | **90.6 s** | **93.2 s** | **0.97 s** | 178,176 of 179,585 | 0 |

Identical hit, no evictions, `kv_util` 0.70 → 0.73. Turn one is 34% faster and turn two stays
where it was. Do this on your own shape before you keep the change: `prefix_hit_rate` and
`prefix_evictions` on `/stats` are the two numbers, and the failure looks like turn two taking
as long as turn one.

**What it does cost is decode, and it is small.** The 239 resident experts the arena takes have to
come from somewhere, and steady-state decode is where. Decode step time from `scripts/cstep2.sh`,
which divides by the decode step counter rather than by wall clock, two passes each, generations
long enough that no sequence retires inside the window:

| chunk | one stream | eight streams |
|---|---|---|
| 512 | 22.35 / 22.29 ms/step | 39.52 / 40.52 ms/step |
| 2048 | 22.42 / 22.48 ms/step | 39.52 / 40.73 ms/step |

**+0.6% on a single-stream decode step**; at eight streams the difference is 0.11 ms, below what
the harness resolves. Against a prefill that is 55% faster and a first turn that goes from 138 s
to 91 s, that is the right side of the trade — but it is a real cost and it lands on every turn,
so measure it on your own shape rather than taking the sign on faith.

**Changing it changes the text.** A different chunk is a different batch shape, so the sums inside
a prefill run in a different order, and at a tie that is a different token. A fixed prompt at a
fixed seed gives one answer at 512 and a different one at 2048, and each is byte-identical across
runs and server restarts at its own setting. Reproducibility holds *at a configuration*, which is what it claims; this flag is part of the
configuration in the same way `--tp` and `--num-speculative-tokens` are. Pin it before you record
anything you intend to compare against later.


### 4.6 Speculative decoding

If the container carries a draft head, it is used by default at the depth the plugin states:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad                              # auto: the drafter's own operating point
radiance --model m.rad --num-speculative-tokens 0   # off
radiance --model m.rad --num-speculative-tokens 3   # a stated depth
```

There is **no `--draft-model`**. This engine loads its drafter from the container — merge one at
conversion time with `rad-convert --draft-model DIR`, or use an MTP head that already ships inside
the target checkpoint, which needs no flag at all. Passing `--draft-model` to the engine is an
error that says so rather than being quietly ignored.

When you measure speculation, **measure step time, not tokens per second.**

### 4.7 Two cards

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --tp 2
radiance --model m.rad --tp 2 --tp-wire wht6 --tp-wire-min-kb 128
```

`--tp-wire` chooses the cross-rank all-reduce payload. `exact` (default) is the bf16 all-reduce.
`wht6` accepts a lossy wire: a Walsh-Hadamard-rotated 6-bit payload, 2.4× smaller over PCIe. The
sum a rank receives is then not the sum it would have received and nothing downstream can tell,
which is why it is a named flag and not a heuristic.

`--tp-wire-min-kb` is the floor below which messages are still served exactly — 128 KiB leaves
single-sequence decode exact and compresses prefill, which is where the win is.

On a model with a gated residual (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) the all-reduce rides inside the residual's
write, with the MoE gather in front of it, on either wire: the rotated forms of `ar_hc_write` and
`ar_gather_hc_write` produce the same bytes as the unfused chain on the same wire. There `wht6` is
worth +5.6–6.3% of prefill at a 2048-token chunk (20K prompt 5556 → 5908 tok/s; a 23K extension at
81K depth 4998 → 5278) and −1.3% of the eight-stream decode step; one-stream decode stays exact.

### 4.8 Finished conversations: copied to host, VRAM given up on demand

By default a finished conversation's KV blocks stay in VRAM, held by the prefix cache, until the
cache evicts them under pressure — and an evicted prefix is re-prefilled from scratch next turn.

With a host tier, a conversation is **copied** to host memory the moment its request finishes, and
keeps its VRAM copy. From then on it is *clean*: its VRAM can be given up for nothing, and it is,
as soon as something wants it — the expert slab's loan, or a request the pool cannot otherwise
serve. A conversation that comes back before that resumes from VRAM; one that comes back after is
restored from host memory and keeps its host copy, so its next turn copies only what that turn
added. There is no idle threshold on the way out of VRAM.

With a disk tier the same happens one level down: every host copy is written on to disk in the
background and keeps its host slot, and once the write has landed the slot can be given up for
nothing. A full host tier gives up its oldest slots when a new copy or a restore needs one, so a
conversation that no longer fits in host memory is on disk already rather than lost.

```sh
radiance --model m.rad \
    --prefix-cache-host-mib 8192 \
    --prefix-cache-disk-mib 65536 --prefix-cache-dir /var/cache/radiance
```

- `--prefix-cache-host-mib N` — **this is the switch.** Without a size, nothing is copied. Part of
  it goes to linear-state snapshots on a hybrid model; startup says how many. Size it for the
  conversations you expect to come back: one that does not fit comes back from disk instead.
- `--prefix-cache-disk-mib N` — the disk tier's size. Everything that reaches host memory is
  written here too, so it sees the same bytes the host tier does.
- `--prefix-cache-dir DIR` — where the disk tier lives. **Not `--weights-disk-tier`**, which is about
  *weights*. The disk tier holds conversation content unencrypted.
- Recovering a 200K-token turn costs a copy over PCIe; recomputing it costs minutes.

On a hybrid model this includes the recurrent state, not just the attention blocks — restoring the
blocks alone leaves the session re-running every linear layer over its whole transcript, which
every hit-rate counter reports as a hit. `/sessions` shows what is stored, where, and whether the
linear half is being served.

### 4.9 What a request that leaves a field out gets

Every default below applies only to a request that does not name the field. A request that names
it wins. Without any of these flags, the server behaves exactly as it always has.

**Temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p.** First one that exists wins:

1. `--temp` / `--top-k` / `--top-p` / `--min-p` on the command line
2. `--generation-config PATH` — a `generation_config.json`
3. `<model>.generation.json` beside the container
4. the container's own `generation.*` metadata
5. the built-in defaults

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --temp 0.7 --top-p 0.8 --top-k 20
```

**The rest of the sampler** has a flag per field, spelled like the request field:
`--presence-penalty`, `--frequency-penalty`, `--repetition-penalty`, `--repeat-last-n`,
`--typical-p`, `--dry-multiplier`, `--dry-base`, `--dry-allowed-length`, `--dry-penalty-last-n`,
`--dry-sequence-breakers` (a JSON array), `--xtc-probability`, `--xtc-threshold`. They are checked
against the same ranges a request is, at startup:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --presence-penalty 1.5 --repetition-penalty 1.05
```

**How much a request may generate.**

- `--default-max-tokens N` sets `max_tokens` for a request that sends none. The default, `auto`,
  is whatever the context leaves after the prompt, as in vLLM. Many clients send no `max_tokens`,
  and a reasoning model can think for thousands of tokens before it answers: a small default ends
  those answers inside the reasoning, with a `finish_reason: "length"` that chat clients do not
  show.
- `--max-tokens-cap N` is the most any request may generate. A larger `max_tokens` is cut to it
  rather than refused, and the reply ends with `finish_reason: "length"`, the same as the context
  bound (§5.8).

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --default-max-tokens auto --max-tokens-cap 32768
```

**Chat template variables.** `--chat-template-kwargs` hands variables to the chat template on
every chat request, the way a request's own `chat_template_kwargs` does:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking": false}'
radiance --model m.rad --chat-template-kwargs @template-vars.json
```

- It takes a JSON object, or `@FILE` to read one. Give it more than once and a later key replaces
  an earlier one.
- A key the request's own `chat_template_kwargs` names is the request's.
- Thinking is one setting with three spellings. A request that says anything about thinking
  (`enable_thinking`, at the top level or in `chat_template_kwargs`, or `reasoning_effort`)
  replaces the server's `enable_thinking`. One that names a `reasoning_effort` replaces the
  server's effort too.
- `messages`, `tools`, `bos_token`, `eos_token` and `add_generation_prompt` are refused: the
  server sets those itself.
- At startup a one-message chat is rendered with the variables. A value the template refuses
  stops startup with the template's own message, instead of failing every request.
- `/tokenize` renders `messages` with the same variables, so the count it gives is the prompt
  chat serves.

**`--reasoning-effort` is worth knowing about.** It is the default for chat requests that do not
set one, and the value goes to the model's chat template verbatim — so the legal set is the
template's. Qwen3.8 takes `xhigh|medium|low` and **defaults to `xhigh`**, which on a short task can
spend the entire token budget inside `<think>` and return a turn with empty content and
`finish_reason: "length"`. `"none"` turns thinking off. It cannot be combined with a
`reasoning_effort` or `enable_thinking` key in `--chat-template-kwargs`. A value the template
refuses is a warning at startup: requests that send their own effort still work.

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --reasoning-effort medium
```

**`--reasoning-format none`** leaves a reasoning block inline in `content` instead of returning it
as `reasoning_content`, for a client that reads it there.

`/server_info` lists every effective default under `request_defaults` (§6.2), and startup prints
one line naming each one the command line moved.

### 4.10 Every flag

`radiance --help` prints this table. Grouped here by what you are doing:

**Model and plugins**

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--model PATH` | the `.rad` container, or a checkpoint served as it stands (§3.4) (**required**) |
| `--radiance-home DIR` | where `kernels/` and `architectures/` live |
| `--kernels LIST` | kernel plugin hierarchy, comma-separated, first wins |

**Batch shape**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--max-num-batched-tokens N` | 8192 | largest token count one step may carry |
| `--max-num-seqs N` | 256 | largest number of sequences one step may carry |
| `--max-model-len N` | 0 | context bound; 0 takes the model's training context |

**Memory**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--gpu-headroom-mib N` | 96 | VRAM left unclaimed on every card |
| `--expert-vs-cache-ratio R` | 0.75 | weights share of what is claimed |
| `--vram-weights-mib N` | derive | the resident weight slab |
| `--vram-kv-mib N` | derive | the paged KV pool |
| `--kv-cache-dtype T` | bf16 | `bf16` or `fp8` |
| `--host-pool-mib N` | 0 | pinned host tier (weights) |
| `--weights-disk-tier` | off | read weights that fit neither VRAM nor the host pool from the container (O_DIRECT); routed experts a layer at a time |

**Idle session tiers**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--prefix-cache-host-mib N` | 0 (off) | copy finished conversations' KV to host memory |
| `--prefix-cache-disk-mib N` | 0 (off) | and copy them on to disk |
| `--prefix-cache-dir DIR` | — | where the disk tier keeps them |

**Placement and state**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--placement MODE` | auto | `all_vram`, `layer_offload`, `expert_tiered`, `auto` |
| `--deterministic` | off | pin placement to the loader's plan, so the resident set cannot change under the heat engine |
| `--checkpoint-interval N` | 2048 | linear-attention state checkpoint interval, in tokens |
| `--checkpoint-slots N` | 8 | linear-state snapshots the server may hold at once, **in total**, not per sequence. A cap, not a charge: slots are backed as they are taken, so unused ones cost no VRAM. Raising it trades addressable context, since the range comes out of the KV pool |
| `--checkpoint-policy NAME` | geometric-backoff | also `tip-only`, `keep-all` |
| `--no-prefix-cache` | — | disable prefix caching |

**Parallel**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--tp N` | 1 | tensor-parallel ranks |
| `--tp-wire MODE` | exact | `exact` or `wht6` |
| `--tp-wire-min-kb N` | 128 | smallest all-reduce the `wht6` wire is used for |

**Speculation**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--num-speculative-tokens N` | auto | speculative window; 0 disables |
| `--draft-model PATH` | — | **not implemented** — merge at convert time |

**Server**

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--host ADDR` | 0.0.0.0 | listen address |
| `--port N` | 8000 | listen port |
| `--api-key KEY` | — | require `Authorization: Bearer KEY` on every request but `/health`, `/ping` and the dashboard page (§6.6) |
| `--served-model-name NAME` | container's name | the model id `/v1/models` lists, the metrics carry and a response names when its request named none. A request may name any model; the one loaded serves it |
| `--mm-max-patches N` | auto | patches one vision-encoder pass carries, and so the largest image (a patch is 16x16 pixels). `auto` is 16384 when the container carries a vision tower; 0 serves text only and keeps the tower off the card |
| `--override-chat-template PATH` | container's | a Jinja chat template file served in place of the one the container carries. The reply format (reasoning markers, tool calls) is derived from it too, unless the architecture plugin declares one. An unreadable or empty file stops startup |
| `--max-queued-requests N` | 8 × `--max-num-seqs` | requests admitted and unfinished at once; past it, 429 |
| `--http-threads N` | one per core, at least 4 | HTTP workers kept while idle |
| `--read-timeout S` | 30 | seconds a client may go silent while sending a request |
| `--write-timeout S` | 600 | seconds one write to a client may block |
| `--keep-alive-timeout S` | 5 | seconds an idle connection is held open between requests |
| `--max-body-mib N` | 512 | the largest request body; images and video arrive base64 inside it |
| `--retry-after S` | 1 | the `Retry-After` a 429 carries |
| `--no-cors` | CORS on | send no CORS headers (§6.6) |

**Request defaults and bounds** — what a request that leaves a field out gets (§4.9). A request
that names the field wins.

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--generation-config PATH` | — | sampler defaults from a `generation_config.json` |
| `--temp F`, `--top-k N`, `--top-p F`, `--min-p F` | from container | sampler defaults |
| `--presence-penalty F`, `--frequency-penalty F` | 0 | [-2, 2] |
| `--repetition-penalty F`, `--repeat-last-n N` | 1, 64 | > 0; ≥ -1 (-1 is all) |
| `--typical-p F` | 1 | (0, 1] |
| `--dry-multiplier F`, `--dry-base F`, `--dry-allowed-length N`, `--dry-penalty-last-n N` | 0, 1.75, 2, -1 | DRY; a multiplier of 0 is off |
| `--dry-sequence-breakers JSON` | `["\n", ":", "\"", "*"]` | a JSON array of at most 16 strings |
| `--xtc-probability F`, `--xtc-threshold F` | 0, 0.1 | [0, 1] |
| `--default-max-tokens N` | `auto` | `max_tokens` for a request that sends none; `auto` is what the context leaves |
| `--max-tokens-cap N` | none | the most any request may generate; a larger `max_tokens` is cut to it, not refused |
| `--max-n N` | the larger of 8 and `--max-num-seqs` | the largest `n` a request may ask for |
| `--max-stop-strings N`, `--max-stop-bytes N` | 64, 4096 | how many stop strings a request may send, and how long each may be |
| `--chat-template-kwargs JSON` | — | variables for the chat template on every chat request; a JSON object or `@FILE`, repeatable |
| `--reasoning-effort S` | template's own | default `reasoning_effort` for chat |
| `--reasoning-format MODE` | auto | `auto` returns reasoning as `reasoning_content`; `none` leaves it inline in `content` |

**Media** — each replaces what the container's preprocessor configuration states. They do nothing
for a model that takes no images or video.

| flag | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--image-min-pixels N`, `--image-max-pixels N` | container's | the band an image is resized into; one encoder pass (`--mm-max-patches`) still bounds the top |
| `--video-min-pixels N`, `--video-max-pixels N` | container's | the same for a video's sampled frames together |
| `--video-fps F` | container's, else 2 | frames sampled per second of video |
| `--video-min-frames N`, `--video-max-frames N` | container's, else 4 and 768 | the fewest and most frames sampled from a video |
| `--video-max-frame-tokens N` | container's, else 768 | the most prompt tokens one frame may become; 0 is no cap |
| `--max-source-pixels N` | 67108864 | the largest image or frame the decoder accepts, before any resize |

**Quality measurement** — instead of serving; see [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md#the-kl-mode)

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--kld-record DIR` | run `--kld-corpus` through prefill and write this model's log-probabilities at every scored position to `DIR`: the reference a quantised model is measured against |
| `--kld-ref DIR` | score this model against the reference in `DIR`: mean, median, 99/99.9/99.99th percentile KL divergence and top-1 agreement |
| `--kld-corpus FILE` | JSONL, one `{"prompt", "score_from"?, "source"?}` a line; `--kld-record` only |
| `--kld-out FILE` | the `--kld-ref` report as JSON, and every position's numbers in `FILE.rows` |

**Diagnostics**

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--debug-graph` | print the declared graph and exit |
| `--debug-selection` | print the selection table |
| `--debug-placement` | print the placement plan |
| `--debug-accept-reference-kernels` | serve even when ops resolve to `libref`. **Not a production configuration** |
| `--profile-ops` | per-op device timing |
| `--live` | the live terminal view |
| `-v` / `-vv` | verbose / very verbose |

---

## 5. Talk to it

### 5.1 The endpoints

| | |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | chat, with tools, reasoning and streaming |
| `POST /v1/completions` | raw text completion |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | needs a model with an embedding head, else 501 |
| `GET /v1/models`, `/v1/models/:id` | what is loaded |
| `GET /health`, `/ping`, `POST /ping` | liveness |
| `GET /load` | current load |
| `GET /version` | server version |
| `GET /server_info` | the whole configuration of the running engine |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus |
| `POST /tokenize`, `POST /detokenize` | |
| `GET /get_tokenizer_info` | |
| `POST /reset_prefix_cache` | drop every cached prefix |
| `GET /` or `/dashboard` | the web dashboard |
| `GET /stats`, `/graph`, `/sessions` | the JSON the dashboard is drawn from |

Method spellings follow vLLM's, including the ones that look odd: `/tokenize` is POST because its
input is a body, and `/ping` answers both GET and POST because different load balancers send
different ones.

### 5.2 Chat

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "m",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain merge sort briefly."}],
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "temperature": 0.7
  }' | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'
```

If the container carries no chat template this endpoint answers **501** and the startup log says
so — use `/v1/completions` instead.

**Turning thinking off.** Three spellings reach the server for one question; all work:

```json
{"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}}
{"enable_thinking": false}
{"reasoning_effort": "none"}
```

Reasoning text comes back in `choices[].message.reasoning_content`, separate from `content`.

### 5.3 Streaming

```sh
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Count to ten."}],
       "max_tokens":100,"stream":true,
       "stream_options":{"include_usage":true}}'
```

Server-sent events, OpenAI's delta format, terminated by `data: [DONE]`.

### 5.4 Tool calls

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "m",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"What is in /etc/hosts?"}],
    "tools": [{
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "read",
        "description": "read a file",
        "parameters": {"type":"object",
                       "properties":{"path":{"type":"string"}},
                       "required":["path"]}
      }
    }],
    "tool_choice": "auto",
    "max_tokens": 300
  }' | jq '.choices[0].message.tool_calls'
```

Calls come back in `message.tool_calls` with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`. No `<function>` or
`<param>` markup ever reaches `content`. `scripts/mctools.sh` and `scripts/mcstream.sh` assert
exactly that, including on raw streamed fragments — content cannot be retracted once sent, so a
repair applied at the end is not a fix.

A tool's `parameters` schema shapes the grammar the call is written under. A property whose schema
accepts no value — `false`, or `{"not": {}}`, which is how TypeBox and Arktype export `never` — is
an argument no call writes. Any other `not` is refused with a 400 naming it: the grammar cannot
express a complement, and dropping the constraint silently would serve a call the tool forbids.

Length bounds are held exactly: `maxLength`, `minLength`, `maxItems` and `minItems` up to about
200,000, which costs the first request carrying the tool under a second to compile on a
quarter-million-token vocabulary and nothing per token after that. A bound past 2^31 (as
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is) is no bound, since no context holds that much. One in between is
refused with a 400 naming the property's rule and the count. The same holds for `response_format`
schemas and `{m,n}` in a GBNF grammar.

### 5.5 Constrained output

```sh
# JSON object
-d '{"model":"m","messages":[...],"response_format":{"type":"json_object"}}'

# a JSON schema
-d '{"model":"m","messages":[...],
     "response_format":{"type":"json_schema",
       "json_schema":{"schema":{"type":"object",
         "properties":{"city":{"type":"string"},"pop":{"type":"integer"}},
         "required":["city","pop"]}}}}'

# a GBNF grammar directly (cannot be combined with response_format)
-d '{"model":"m","prompt":"...","grammar":"root ::= \"yes\" | \"no\""}'
```

**On chat, a constraint passes through the chat template and may not survive it.** The template
gets to rewrite or drop `grammar` and `response_format` — a tool-calling template produces its own
grammar, for instance — so whether a constraint can be enforced is a property of the model's
template and not only of the server. When the one you asked for is not there at the end, the
request is **refused**:

```
grammar: this model's chat template produced no grammar for it, so the constraint could not
be enforced
```

That is the refused-not-ignored rule (§5.8) doing its job: an unconstrained 200 would leave you
parsing free prose against a schema you were told was enforced. `/v1/completions` has no template
in the way, so the same grammar works there — which is why the example above uses it.

### 5.6 Completions, embeddings, tokenising

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"m","prompt":"def fib(n):","max_tokens":128,"temperature":0}'

curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/embeddings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"m","input":"hello"}'

curl -s http://localhost:8000/tokenize -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"hello world","return_token_strs":true}'

curl -s http://localhost:8000/tokenize -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'    # applies the chat template

curl -s http://localhost:8000/detokenize -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tokens":[15339,1917]}'
```

`/tokenize` takes `prompt` **or** `messages`, not both.

### 5.7 Request fields

| field | notes |
|---|---|
| `model` | accepted and not enforced — one server serves one model |
| `messages` / `prompt` / `input` | chat / completion / embedding |
| `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens` | default: what the context leaves after the prompt (`--default-max-tokens`). Clamped to what the context leaves, and to `--max-tokens-cap`, rather than refused — see §5.8 |
| `temperature` | [0, 2] |
| `top_p` | (0, 1] |
| `top_k` | ≥ 0, 0 disables |
| `min_p`, `typical_p` | |
| `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` | [-2, 2] |
| `repetition_penalty`, `repeat_last_n` | |
| `xtc_probability`, `xtc_threshold` | |
| `dry_multiplier`, `dry_base`, `dry_allowed_length`, `dry_penalty_last_n`, `dry_sequence_breakers` | |
| `seed` | absent means "pick one" — **not** seed 0 |
| `n` | 1 to `--max-n`, by default the larger of 8 and `--max-num-seqs`. Fan-out over the same prompt; the prefix cache makes it nearly free after the first |
| `priority` | |
| `stop` | a string or an array; at most 64 strings of 4096 bytes (`--max-stop-strings`, `--max-stop-bytes`) |
| `ignore_eos` | generate to `max_tokens` whatever the model emits |
| `stream`, `stream_options.include_usage` | |
| `logprobs`, `top_logprobs` | **not implemented** — refused, not returned as nulls. `/server_info` reports `logprobs: false` |
| `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls` | chat only |
| `add_generation_prompt`, `chat_template_kwargs` | chat only |
| `reasoning_effort`, `enable_thinking` | chat only |
| `preserve_thinking` | chat only. The chat template variable of that name, as llama.cpp maps it; Qwen3.6 and later keep earlier turns' reasoning in the prompt with it |
| `response_format` | chat only. Mutually exclusive with `grammar` |
| `grammar` | a GBNF grammar directly. On chat it passes through the chat template and a template that drops it makes the request a refusal — see §5.5 |
| `echo` | `/v1/completions` only |
| `encoding_format` | `/v1/embeddings` only: `float` or `base64`. `dimensions` is refused — the embedding width is fixed |

Any field the request omits keeps the deployment default (§4.9). A field the request names wins.

### 5.8 A parameter this server does not implement is **refused**, not ignored

This is the one place radiance deliberately differs from what an OpenAI client may expect, and it
will be the first thing you hit pointing an existing client at it:

```json
{"error": {"message": "mirostat: mirostat is not one of the device samplers (spec 13)", ...}}
```

The rule is that **a request that returns 200 means every field of it was honoured**. Silently
dropping a sampler setting and answering 200 is how a deployment ends up serving a model at
settings nobody chose.

Three lists decide it:

- **Accepted** — the table above.
- **Inert** — OpenAI metadata that genuinely does nothing anywhere, accepted and ignored so the
  official SDKs work: `user`, `metadata`, `store`, `service_tier`, `safety_identifier`,
  `prompt_cache_key`.
- **Refused with a reason** — known, not implemented, each named:

| refused | because |
|---|---|
| `logit_bias` | the device sampler has no per-token bias stage |
| `functions`, `function_call` | deprecated — send `tools` / `tool_choice` |
| `best_of` | sampling n candidates and returning the best is not implemented |
| `suffix` | infilling is not implemented |
| `mirostat`, `mirostat_tau`, `mirostat_eta` | not one of the device samplers |
| `top_n_sigma`, `dynatemp_range`, `dynatemp_exponent` | not one of the device samplers |
| `lora` | explicitly out of scope |
| `modalities`, `audio`, `prediction` | not implemented |
| `continue_final_message` | assistant prefill is not implemented |
| `cache_prompt` | prefix caching is a server-wide setting, not per request |

Anything else unrecognised is refused too, naming the key.

**The one exception is `max_tokens`.** If `prompt + max_tokens` would exceed the context, the
server clamps `max_tokens` to what is left and serves the request:

```
prompt 72,170 + max_tokens 128,000  >  200,000 context
                                    ->  served with max_tokens 127,830
```

It is an exception because the other keys are *settings* — dropping one serves a different model
than the caller asked for — and this one is a *bound*, whose whole purpose is to stop generation
early and which the context was going to stop earlier anyway. Refusing would not produce more
tokens than clamping does; it would produce none. The completion ends with `finish_reason:
"length"` and `usage` reports what it actually got, so the caller can still see what happened, and
`-v` logs the adjustment.

A prompt that does not fit **on its own** is still a 400 — there is no window to generate into, so
no `max_tokens` would have made it servable — and the error names how many tokens have to go:

```
prompt: 220470 prompt tokens does not fit the 200000 token context, which leaves nothing to
generate into; shorten the prompt by at least 20471 tokens
```

At the boundary, where an off-by-one would hide: a 198,729-token prompt asking for `max_tokens`
128,000 against a 200,000 context is served, generates **1,271** tokens — exactly the room left —
and ends `finish_reason: "length"`. `POST /tokenize` is how to size a prompt that
precisely without running the model.

## 6. Operate it

### 6.1 The dashboard

Open `http://<host>:<port>/` in a browser. Three tabs:

**Dashboard** — the live strip across the top (decode step time, decode and prefill throughput,
requests in flight, KV cache in VRAM, draft acceptance), then cards for the batch, memory and
interconnect, and the expert plane.

The **KV cache** meter splits what it is holding into two segments:

```
KV cache   3.3 GiB / 4.5 GiB · 390.1k tok · 75.5%
▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
20.8k tok in flight · 369.3k held for the next turn
```

The full-strength segment is live requests; the ghost segment is **prefix cache** — finished turns
kept so the next turn need not re-prefill. Held is not a second pool: it gives way the moment a
live request needs it. A high held figure with a high hit rate is the cache doing its job, not a
leak. Both segments take their warning colour from the *total* fill, since what causes preemption
is the pool being full.

**Sessions** — one row per stored conversation: how many tokens, which tier it is in, and whether
its linear half is still reachable. Sizes **overlap and cannot be added up**: two sessions sharing
a system prompt share the blocks for it, which is the whole point of a prefix cache.

On a hybrid model, a session with blocks but no reachable snapshot reuses **zero** tokens — the
scheduler clamps reuse to the last linear checkpoint. That verdict is the headline of the tab.

**Model** — the resolved graph: every op, which library serves it, and what did not resolve.

### 6.2 The JSON behind it

```sh
curl -s localhost:8000/stats | jq          # counters, memory, throughput
curl -s localhost:8000/sessions | jq       # what is stored and where
curl -s localhost:8000/graph | jq          # the resolved kernel graph
curl -s localhost:8000/server_info | jq    # model, cards, KV, draft depth, wire
```

`/server_info` is the operator's first question asked of a process that is already running: which
model, on how many cards, with how much KV, drafting how deeply, over which wire. All of it is in
the startup log too — but a startup log is on a machine, in a file, from a process that may have
been restarted since.

Its `request_defaults` object says what a request that leaves a field out is served with: every
sampler field, `max_tokens`, `reasoning_effort`, `chat_template_kwargs` and `reasoning_format`,
under the request's own spelling of each. `server.default_max_tokens` is `null` for `auto`, and
`server.max_tokens_cap` is `null` when there is none.

### 6.3 Metrics

`GET /metrics` is Prometheus text. Two families:

**`vllm:` — the compatibility set**, so existing dashboards work: `num_requests_running`,
`num_requests_waiting`, `num_preemptions_total`, `gpu_cache_usage_perc`, `kv_cache_usage_perc`,
`gpu_prefix_cache_hit_rate`, `prompt_tokens_total`, `generation_tokens_total`,
`time_to_first_token_seconds`, `time_per_output_token_seconds`, `inter_token_latency_seconds`,
`request_prompt_tokens`, `request_generation_tokens`, `request_success_total`, …

**`radiance:` — what this engine actually has**:

| | |
|---|---|
| `engine_steps_total`, `_decode_total`, `_prefill_total`, `_mixed_total` | step counts by kind |
| `engine_step_seconds_total`, `_decode_total` | **the honest step time denominator** |
| `decode_tokens_total`, `prefill_tokens_total` | |
| `decode_tokens_per_second`, `prefill_tokens_per_second` | |
| `draft_tokens_total`, `draft_accepted_total`, `draft_acceptance_ratio` | |
| `draft_position_reached_total`, `draft_position_acceptance_ratio` | acceptance by position in the window |
| `decode_rows_unspeculated_total` | rows that never drafted at all |
| `attn_cached_tokens_total`, `linear_cached_tokens_total` | prefix reuse, both halves |
| `linear_checkpoints_written_total`, `linear_prefix_cache_hit_rate` | |
| `prefix_cache_evictions_total`, `prefix_cache_ckpt_evictions_total` | |
| `num_requests_preempted` | |
| `http_queue_depth`, `http_responses_total`, `http_admission_rejected_total` | |
| `client_disconnect_total`, `stream_overflow_total` | |

Two traps worth naming:

- **`draft_acceptance_ratio` is conditional on having drafted.** It reads healthy while
  tokens-per-step collapses. The quantity that separates the two is blocks per step —
  `draft_tokens_total / depth` over `engine_steps_decode_total`. `scripts/mcdecl.sh` measures it.
- **Step time is not wall-clock over steps.** Use `engine_step_seconds_decode_total /
  engine_steps_decode_total`, which charges only decode. Wall-clock charges idle and prefill to it.

### 6.4 The live terminal view

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --live
```

Cards, throughput, draft acceptance and the expert plane, redrawn in place. **Redirected it prints
one greppable `key=value` line instead**, so it is usable from a script:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --live >> serve.log 2>&1
```

The step counter is the field that tells a stalled loop from an idle one: throughput decays toward
zero on its own, but a step count frozen between two draws means the loop itself stopped.

### 6.5 Logging

```sh
RADIANCE_LOG=debug radiance --model m.rad     # error|warn|info|debug|trace
radiance --model m.rad -v                     # same as debug
radiance --model m.rad -vv                    # same as trace
```

### 6.6 Security

**There is no TLS, and without `--api-key` there is no authentication.** CORS is on, so a page on
any origin can call the API from a browser; `--no-cors` turns it off.

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --api-key "$KEY"
```

With a key, every request must carry `Authorization: Bearer KEY` or it is answered 401 —
`/tokenize` and `/server_info` included, since they hand out the vocabulary, the chat template and
the configuration. Three paths are exempt: `/health` and `/ping`, because a load balancer cannot
carry a bearer token and an authenticated probe is a server that reports itself down, and the
dashboard page itself (`/`, `/dashboard`), which holds no data — on a 401 it shows a key field,
keeps the key in the browser's storage and sends it on every fetch of data it makes.

The key is checked, not encrypted: on any network you do not control, bind to localhost and put a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front:

```sh
radiance --model m.rad --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --api-key "$KEY"
```

Also note `--prefix-cache-disk-mib` writes **conversation content unencrypted** under `--prefix-cache-dir`.

### 6.7 Restarting and stopping

Nothing here is a daemon; run it under systemd, a supervisor or `nohup`. `scripts/fnstop.sh` stops
a running server and waits for the process to actually go — which matters, because VRAM is not
released until it does.

## 7. When something goes wrong

| What you see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `N declared op(s) resolve to libref` and the engine exits | No kernel library covers those ops on this card. Serving from the reference implementation would be orders of magnitude slow with nothing to say so | Install a library that covers them, or accept the cost with `--debug-accept-reference-kernels`. The named ops are exactly what a new library must implement |
| `did not fit` at load, naming a weight class or a KV group | The split left one side too little. A routed expert cannot be served from the file tier, so it has nowhere else to go | If **weights** did not fit: **raise** `--expert-vs-cache-ratio`, lower `--max-model-len` or `--max-num-seqs`, or add `--host-pool-mib`. If a **KV group** did not fit: lower the ratio, or `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`. The plan report names which, by class, with the shortfall |
| `chat is 501` in the startup line | The container carries no chat template | Re-convert with `--tokenizer`, and check that a `chat_template.jinja` sits beside `tokenizer_config.json` in the checkpoint. Meanwhile use `/v1/completions` |
| `does not read '<weight>' encoded <encoding>` at startup | No loaded kernel takes that weight's encoding for the op that reads it | Convert with a recipe that writes an encoding a loaded kernel reads, or load the library that reads it |
| Prefix hit rate 0% and every turn re-prefills | The KV pool cannot hold the live sessions, so the cache evicts what the next turn wanted | Lower `--expert-vs-cache-ratio` (more to KV), or `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`, or fewer/shorter sessions. See §4.3 |
| The server dies with no log line, on a request it had been serving fine | A kernel whose code object had never been loaded could not be: the card has no room left. HIP faults inside the launch rather than returning an error, so there is nothing to print | A card that never met `--gpu-headroom-mib` — see §4.3. Raise the headroom past the shortfall startup names. `coredumpctl info` names the kernel; `AMD_LOG_LEVEL=1` prints `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` just above the fault |
| KV in VRAM stays high with one session and nothing moves | The idle tiers are **off** — they are sized, and with no size nothing is copied | Pass `--prefix-cache-host-mib N` |
| `out of memory` / `the carve reserved N of address space and the card would not back it` | Something else is holding VRAM | Check with `rocm-smi`; stop the other process. The budget is stated before allocation, so the log says what it asked for |
| `--draft-model is not implemented` | This engine loads its drafter from the container | `rad-convert --draft-model DIR` at conversion time |
| `context_length_exceeded` on a request | The **prompt alone** does not fit the context. `max_tokens` is clamped rather than refused, so this fires only when there is no room left to generate at all | Shorten the prompt by the number of tokens the message names, or raise `--max-model-len` if the model allows it |
| `unknown option '--foo'` and the engine exits | Deliberate. A typo in a budget flag is the difference between the plan you asked for and one the planner invented | Check `radiance --help` |
| Empty `content` and `finish_reason: "length"` on short chat turns | The template's default `reasoning_effort` spent the budget inside `<think>` | `--reasoning-effort medium`, or `"reasoning_effort": "none"` per request |
| `401` with `invalid api key` | The server was started with `--api-key` | Send `Authorization: Bearer KEY` (§6.6) |

First three things to run when a server will not start:

```sh
rad-info m.rad                            # is the container what you think it is?
radiance --model m.rad --debug-graph      # does every op resolve?
rad-kbench --home $RADIANCE_HOME --max-cases 1   # are the kernels correct at all?
```

---

## 8. Environment

**Operator-facing**

| | |
|---|---|
| `RADIANCE_HOME` | where `kernels/`, `architectures/` and `quantizers/` live; a `:`-separated search path, the first home winning. Same as `--radiance-home` |
| `RADIANCE_KERNELS` | default kernel hierarchy, comma-separated. Same as `--kernels`, read by the engine *and* every tool, so a plugin validated with `rad-kbench` can be served without editing launchers |
| `RADIANCE_LOG` | `error` \| `warn` \| `info` \| `debug` \| `trace` |
| `ROCM_PATH` | where ROCm lives, if not `/opt/rocm` |
| `HF_TOKEN` | for `scripts/hfget.sh` on a gated repo |

**Tooling**

| | |
|---|---|
| `RADIANCE_TUNE` | pin a kernel's tunable axes instead of reading the tune cache — `op:key=value[,key=value][;op:...]`. For comparing tunings, not for deployment |
| `RADIANCE_CALIB_DIR` | where an engine run writes calibration data for a recipe's `gptq calib=DIR` |
| `RADIANCE_CALIB_TOKENS` | with `RADIANCE_CALIB_DIR`, the tokens the calibration tap accumulates before it writes and switches itself off (default 65536) |
| `RADIANCE_PROFILE_EVERY` | with `--profile-ops`, dump the per-op table every N steps (default 32) |
| `RADIANCE_LOG_STEPS` | log one line per step: its phase, sequences, and each one's token count and context (§4.5) |

There is also a family of instruments for engine development — `RADIANCE_DEBUG_*` (residual probes,
idle scrubs, routing and issue dumps), `RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE*` (named ops checked against `libref` on
the operands the model issued; `scripts/oracle.sh` drives it) and `RADIANCE_OP_REPEAT` (named ops
run a second time on the same inputs, to ask whether a kernel is a function of them). They are
instruments, not features; grep `getenv` if you need one, and read the comment beside it first.
