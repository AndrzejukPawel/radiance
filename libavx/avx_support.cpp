/* avx_support.cpp -- the dtype-generic row and the row reductions, compiled once per ISA level.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE OUT OF LINE AND NOT IN THE HEADER. They are called from every kernel with a
 * runtime dtype, so inlining them would paste a fifteen-way switch into sixty-eight call sites and
 * the switch is the thing being hoisted out of the loop in the first place. Out of line, the
 * branch is taken ONCE PER ROW and the body it lands in is a straight vector loop the hardware
 * prefetcher can see through.
 *
 * The conversion rates per level are measured by `rad-avx-bench --cvt` and recorded in
 * libavx/README.md rather than here, because they are a property of the machine the bench last ran
 * on and a number typed into a comment outlives the machine that produced it.
 *
 * The two fp8 decodes take different paths and avx_vec.h says why: e4m3 is a branchless bit
 * reconstruction, e5m2 a table gather, and the scalar level and every tail element read the table
 * in both cases.

 * The conventions are libr4d's, because a .rad is specific to a kernel set (spec §4.2) and this
 * plugin has to read the same bytes: W4 is two nibbles a byte with element 2i LOW and a symmetric
 * two's-complement code ((n ^ 8) - 8), W2 four codes a byte with the same construction one radix
 * down, MXFP4 two e2m1 nibbles with the magnitude table below. libref/ref_common.h is the written
 * definition and this is the vectorised reading of it.
 *
 * THE W4 UNPACK IS A SHUFFLE, NOT A SHIFT PER ELEMENT. Sixteen nibble pairs are one 128-bit load;
 * the low nibbles are an AND and the high ones a shift, and the two interleave back with a
 * punpcklbw -- four instructions for 32 elements against 32 shifts and 32 masks scalar. W2 and
 * MXFP4 are left scalar: W2 appears only in the draft head's lm_head and MXFP4 only in an expert
 * grid this plugin does not serve at speed, so neither is on a path worth the code. */

 *
 * THE ELIGIBILITY TEST SPLITS AT THE PREVIOUS PICK, and that is what makes it vectorisable at all.
 * The rule is "skip anything above the last pick, and skip the last pick itself and everything

 * it is equivalent to two PURE VALUE tests over two ranges:
 *
 *     i <= pi    eligible iff  !(v > pv)  and  v != pv

 * data it reads a fraction of the row. libref does one scalar pass with two unpredictable branches
 * per element; at a 248K vocabulary and R = 16 that is eight million of them.
 *
 * `!(v > pv)` RATHER THAN `v <= pv` IS DELIBERATE and is why the comparisons below are the

 * treats a NaN as eligible. Matching it costs nothing here.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT MATCH, stated rather than hidden: libref seeds its running best with the FIRST
 * eligible element and only replaces it on a strict `>`, so an eligible NaN encountered first stays
 * the winner for the whole row. A vector max cannot reproduce that, and this returns the largest

/* ================================================================== the machine's FMA ceiling
 *
 * THE CEILING HAS TO BE MEASURED WITH THE FLAGS THE KERNELS ARE COMPILED WITH, which is why this
 * lives here -- in a file compiled once per ISA level -- and not in rad-avx-bench, which is
 * baseline-compiled like the dispatcher and can only ever emit SSE2. A bench that reported the
 * scalar chain as "the machine's peak" would be reporting something ten times below what a GEMM
 * at this level is up against, and every kernel would look like it was doing well.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES: a dependency-free chain of independent FMA accumulators, all in registers,
 * nothing touching memory. What comes out is what the machine RETIRES, including whatever clock it
 * actually holds under a sustained vector load -- which on a part with an AVX-512 frequency offset
 * is not the advertised boost, and is exactly the number a kernel is competing with.
 *
 * THE ACCUMULATOR COUNT IS THE REGISTER FILE, and getting it wrong understates the ceiling rather
 * than overstating it -- which is worse, because every kernel then looks good against it. Sixteen
 * accumulators plus the two constants is EIGHTEEN live vectors, which fits AVX-512's 32 registers
 * and spills on AVX2's and AVX's 16. With sixteen everywhere the AVX2 peak comes out barely above
 * the AVX one -- a step of a few percent for turning two instructions into one, where the ports
 * say 2x -- because the spill is inside the loop. Ten accumulators covers a 4-5 cycle FMA latency
 * against 2 FMA ports with room to spare and leaves six registers free.
 *
 * `volatile` on the sink, so the whole loop is not deleted. The accumulators are read out through
 * it; without that the compiler is entirely within its rights to remove the work and report an
 * infinite ceiling, which is the classic way this measurement is wrong. */
