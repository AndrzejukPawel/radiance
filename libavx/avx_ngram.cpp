/* avx_ngram.cpp -- where embed_lookup_q's rows come from, and the table's stored arrangement.
 * BASELINE-COMPILED: no -m flags, like avx_dispatch.cpp. Nothing here is vector arithmetic; the
 * decode that is arrives from the calling level (avx_rows.h).
 *
 * ============================== WHY THIS GATHER IS A HOST KERNEL ==============================
 *
 * An n-gram embedding of 320,001,536 rows of 160 E4M3 is 51.2 GB, read SIXTEEN ROWS A TOKEN, and
 * every mechanism for an oversized weight is built for a different shape of access:
 *
 *   Tier::SSD + DeviceStaged   stages a WHOLE movement unit into a slab slot and DMAs it. Staging
 *                              51.2 GB to use 5 KB is not a slow path, it is the wrong shape.
 *   Site::DeviceZeroCopy       wants it in pinned host RAM, which a table this size does not fit.
 *   hipHostRegister on the map pins, so it would force all 51.2 GB resident. Same wall.
 *
 * core/format/radfile.cpp mmaps the whole container -- "LOAD IS MAP-AND-GO" -- so the table is at
 * a HOST virtual address the moment the model opens, backed by a file on an NVMe. A sparse gather
 * of sixteen rows out of 320 million is a caching problem -- nothing can predict which rows are hot
 * -- but for a cache of ROWS, not of the 4 KiB pages the OS would keep; see the row cache below.
 * (core/place/mover.h rejects mmap for the WEIGHT POOL and that argument does not reach here -- it
 * is about SWEEPING a working set, where residency is controlled explicitly.)
 *
 * So the gather runs on the host, over the container's own mapping, and its [T, n_embd] bf16
 * result crosses the link once -- a few kilobytes a token at decode. The placement planner puts an
 * op on the host when every WEIGHT operand of it is Site::Host (core/runtime/ctx.cpp), which is why
 * the table has to be a weight operand: `gather_rows` takes a plain IN operand and would never
 * trigger it. A host op needs a host kernel in a production plugin -- libref is the oracle and
 * rad_gate_reference_kernels refuses to serve on it -- and host kernels are this plugin's.
 *
 * ============================== A SHARED ROW CACHE, AND DIRECT READS FOR ITS MISSES ==============================
 *
 * The gather is not arithmetic. 160 table bytes decode to 160 bf16 in a few dozen cycles; what a
 * row costs is getting its bytes, and at decode most of them have never been read before: eight
 * varied sequences want ~487 distinct rows a step, and about half of those are an n-gram hashed for
 * the first time (see the trace note below). No cache serves those; they are reads.
 *
 * THE PAGE CACHE IS THE WRONG CACHE FOR THIS TABLE, twice over. A buffered read of an uncached page
 * costs the submitting thread ~4 us -- page allocation, page-cache insertion, block mapping and the
 * bio all run inside the submission -- so a call's cold rows are started one after another: ~380 of
 * them take ~1.5 ms to submit, and the drive finishes the burst ~0.25 ms after the last one. And it
 * caches a 4 KiB page for a 160-byte row that shares its page with nothing else a gather wants, so
 * every miss evicts 4 KiB of some other file's cache to keep 160 bytes of this one.
 *
 * SO THE ROWS HAVE THEIR OWN CACHE, AND A MISS IS A DIRECT READ. RowCache below holds rows, not
 * pages, and every thread that gathers from the table shares it. A miss is an O_DIRECT read of the
 * aligned span holding the row: ~2 us to submit, nothing inserted anywhere, 512 bytes off the drive
 * where a page read takes 4096. At eight varied sequences a cache of 2^19 rows (80 MiB at 160 bytes)
 * misses 51.0% of rows, against 50.6% for an unbounded one.
 *
 * EACH MISS IS READ ONCE, BY WHICHEVER THREAD CLAIMS IT. Every rank gathers every row. A thread
 * claims a missing row by marking its slot LOADING, reads it and publishes it READY; a thread that
 * finds a row another thread is loading waits for it instead of reading it again. The ranks walk a
 * call's rows from different starting points, so each claims about its own share of the misses and
 * the cold work is divided between them rather than duplicated -- with no barrier between the
 * ranks: a late rank finds the rows already there.
 *
 * THE FILE COMES FROM THE MAPPING. The table operand is a pointer into the container's mmap and the
 * plugin ABI carries no file, so /proc/self/maps says which file and offset back that address, once
 * a table. A table no file backs -- a test's heap buffer -- is read as the memory it is. A file on a
 * filesystem that cannot do direct I/O is refused; direct_granule below finds the alignment the
 * reads keep, including on a filesystem that does not report one. */

 * behind it. The NEXT chunk's ids are known a step early (RadBatch::n_ahead, ngram_ids'

 * claims each row the cache lacks, reads it and publishes it READY while the chunk runs on the
 * card; the next call finds its rows in the cache, or LOADING under the reader's tag, and waits
 * for those exactly as it waits for a row the other rank is reading.
 *
 * Both ranks hand over the same ids, and the second hand-over of a list the reader already has is

/* ============================== THE ROW-ID TRACE ==============================
 *
 * AVX_PLE_TRACE=<path> appends every row id this op gathers, one per line. Off unless the variable
 * is set, and it changes nothing the op computes. Two design questions -- "does the page cache ever
 * hit" and "would a userspace cache of 160-byte rows beat it, being 25x denser than a 4 KiB page
 * holding one useful row" -- are the SAME question about the n-gram reuse rate, and that is a
 * property of the text being generated rather than of this code. This is how to measure it on a
 * real generation.
 *
 * ---- WHAT IT SHOWS ON A PREFILL, WHICH IS WHERE THE ROWS ARE ----------------------------------
 *
 * A ~24k-token prefill of prose, both ranks traced, with the rows read through the container's
 * mapping rather than the row cache (fault counts from /proc/<pid>/stat):
 *
 *      762,432 rows gathered      277,911 distinct      450,608 MINOR faults      2 MAJOR
 *
 * THE PAGE CACHE HITS ESSENTIALLY ALWAYS once warm. Two major faults over a whole prefill: what a
 * read through the mapping pays instead is PAGE-TABLE POPULATION -- a minor fault to map an
 * already-cached page, about 1.2 of them per row gathered, at roughly a microsecond each.
 *
 * THE DENSITY ARGUMENT HOLDS AND IT IS THE WHOLE PRIZE. The distinct rows a prefill wants land on
 * 274,887 distinct 4 KiB pages: 1.011 USEFUL ROWS A PAGE, where a page holds 25. So 44.5 MB of
 * wanted row bytes is reached through 1.13 GB of page mapping. The packed row cache above keeps
 * only the rows touched and pays no mapping at all.
 *
 * THE REUSE RATE ALONE DOES NOT CARRY IT. Per rank the same prefill gathers 381,216 rows over
 * 277,911 distinct ones -- 1.37x, and 86% of rows are wanted exactly once. A cache justified by
 * reuse would be a poor bet; one justified by density is a good one, and those are different
 * arguments for the same structure.
 *
 * ---- AND AT DECODE, WHERE THE STEP WAITS ON IT ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Eight varied sequences at a depth-3 verify, one rank traced: a call is 512 rows over ~487
 * distinct ones, and 50.6% of those are rows the generation has never asked for before -- the
 * floor for any cache. The rest recur within a short window: a row-granular LRU of 10^5 rows misses
 * 57.8%, of 4 x 10^5 rows 51.2%, and larger buys nothing. RowCache -- 2^19 rows, eight ways, CLOCK,
 * shared by the ranks -- misses 51.0% on the same trace.
 *
 * (The even split in the raw trace is the two RANKS, not reuse. Both hash the same ids and gather
 * the same rows -- see the replication note in arch/common/rad_block_ple.h, which prices that.) */

/* ============================== THE TABLE'S ENCODING, AND ITS ONE SCALE ==============================
 *
 * Asked at declare, not by a step (spec §4.3).
 *
 * The table is E4M3, row-major, with ONE bf16 scale for all of it -- `fp8_e4m3*bf16[*x*]`. That
 * is not a simplification of a per-block scheme: it is the shipped format, and the structure of
 * the data is why it works. E4M3 carries its own exponent; a row of this table has a dynamic range
 * of only about 2.3x; and the error sits on a THREE-OCTAVE PLATEAU in the scale, so any value from
 * 2^-13 to 2^-10 gives the same relative L2 error to five digits. A per-row scale would buy a few
 * percent of that error for 1.25% more bytes, which is why the format has none. (INT8 in the same
 * byte would buy several times more, because it spends all eight bits on resolution rather than
 * four on an exponent this data does not need. That is a different format.)
 *
 * IT IS STORED AS IT IS: the gather reads the canonical rows, and that is what lets the table be
 * read in place from the container's mapping -- a relayout would need a copy of 51 GB. So this
 * hook only checks, and a table quantised any other way is refused at declare rather than
 * gathered as noise. A plain bf16 table -- the checkpoint's own, 102 GB -- is the one other form
 * it takes, read the same way with no scale. */
