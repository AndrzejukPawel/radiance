/* avx_attn.cpp -- paged attention, dense attention, the KV write, and the two rotary forms.
 *
 * ============================== THE PAGED LAYOUT ==============================
 *
 *     kv_cache[num_blocks, kv_heads, block_size, 2 * head_dim]      K then V inside a slot
 *
 * libr4d's, stated once for the whole project in libref/ref_ops.h, obeyed here. A flat slot index
 * s decomposes as block = s / block_size, offset = s % block_size; `block_table[seq, i]` holds the
 * block id of the sequence's i-th block and `slot_mapping[token]` the flat slot a token writes to.
 *
 * ============================== THE MASK ==============================
 *
 * `seqused[s]` is the sequence's TOTAL key count INCLUDING this step's query tokens, so query row
 * i of a q_len-row step sits at absolute position seqused[s] - q_len + i. That is what makes one
 * kernel serve a decode (q_len 1), a speculative verify (q_len <= 64) and a prefill chunk (q_len
 * in the thousands) with no second length parameter.
 *
 *   causal = 1   key j is visible when j <= pos
 *   causal = 0   key j is visible when j <  seqused[s]
 *   window > 0   causal: additionally pos - j < window; non-causal: |pos - j| < window, the
 *                two-sided reading libr4d's h128 kernel documents.
 *
 * ============================== ONE PASS OVER THE CACHE, NOT TWO ==============================
 *
 * This is the one place where this plugin deliberately computes the softmax in a DIFFERENT ORDER
 * from the oracle, and it is worth being explicit about the trade.
 *
 * libref makes two passes over the whole context: one to find the maximum score, one to
 * exponentiate and accumulate -- and it RECOMPUTES every dot product in the second pass, because
 * keeping them would need a buffer the size of the context and "the reference has time it does not
 * have memory". At a 128K context that is two full sweeps of the KV cache and twice the dot
 * products, and the KV cache is the largest thing a decode step touches.
 *
 * Here the softmax is ONLINE and tiled, the flash-attention arrangement: keys are taken in tiles,
 * a tile's scores are computed once, the running maximum is updated at the tile boundary and the
 * accumulator rescaled by exp(m_old - m_new) when it moves. One pass, one dot product per key, and
 * the memory is one tile of scores rather than one context of them.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS: the rescalings round. The result is mathematically identical -- the final running
 * maximum IS the global maximum, and every weight ends up as exp(s_j - m_final) -- but the
 * intermediate multiplications are extra roundings that libref does not perform, so this cannot be
 * bit-exact against it and does not claim to be. It lands at ~1e-7 relative against a tolerance of
 * 1e-4 (f32) / 2e-2 (bf16). Every other numerical choice in this file is exact by construction:
 *
 *   THE DESCALES ARE APPLIED PER ELEMENT, NOT TO THE DOT. libref computes
 *   `dot += q[d] * (k[d] * kds)`, which is not the same f32 number as `dot(q, k) * kds`. The K row
 *   is therefore scaled by `kds` as it is widened, which reproduces the reference's arithmetic
 *   exactly rather than to a tolerance. Same for V and `vds`.
 *
 *   AN EMPTY WINDOW IS A ZERO ROW, NOT A NaN. A softmax over no visible key has no defined answer
 *   and zero is what every kernel in this project produces. The checker compares the finiteness
 *   pattern before any norm, so getting this wrong is a hard failure rather than a tolerance
 *   question -- which is the right treatment.

 * guess -- and getting it wrong produces fluent text with a broken sense of position, which is the

 * `1/pow(theta, 2i/rot)` and then a cos and a sin FOR EVERY (token, head, i) -- three libm calls
 * per element, on an op that otherwise does two multiplies and an add. But the angle depends only
 * on (position, i): every head of a token wants the same cos/sin. Building the row's table once
 * and reusing it across all n_head + n_head_kv heads removes (heads - 1)/heads of the transcendental
 * work, which at 32 heads is 97% of it, and the values are identical because they are the same
 * computation performed once instead of many times -- so this is bit-identical, not merely close.
 *
 * The inverse frequencies depend only on `i` and are built ONCE PER LAUNCH for the same reason.
 *
 * What is NOT vectorised is the cos/sin themselves: a vector sincos is a polynomial with its own
