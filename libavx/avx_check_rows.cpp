/* avx_check_rows.cpp -- embed_lookup_q over a FILE-BACKED table, the form a model serves it in.
 *
 * The geometry table checks the op against libref over a heap buffer, which the gather reads as
 * memory. A table in a container is not read that way: its rows come through a row cache every
 * thread shares, with direct reads of the file for the cache's misses and a reader thread a call
 * ahead (avx_ngram.cpp). What can go wrong there is WHICH bytes arrive -- a slot claimed twice, a
 * row decoded from a slot that was taken over, a wait on a claim that was given up -- and libref
 * has no such path to compare against, so the answer here is the file's own bytes.
 *
 * Two threads play the ranks of one call, as the engine's rank threads do: the same ids, rank 0
 * and 1 of 2, released together, so a thread claims rows, waits on rows the other has claimed, and
 * meets its own claim again when an id repeats within a call. Half the ids come from a small hot
 * set the cache keeps; the rest from a table four times the cache's 2^19 rows, so sets fill and
 * rows are evicted while the other thread may be reading them. Every call also hands over the NEXT
 * call's ids as `ahead`, as the engine's prefill does, so the reader thread claims and reads those
 * rows while this call's threads are still decoding theirs: a third thread in every race above.
 *
 * Every output row is compared bit for bit with that id's bytes in the file through the call's
 * scale, and a padding id must come back as a zero row. The row is 40 codes, so the AVX-512 decode
 * takes one full 32-code step and a masked tail. The table is a file in `dir`, and the filesystem
 * there decides how the gather aligns its direct reads: by the alignment the filesystem reports
 * (ext4, XFS), or by its block size where it reports none (btrfs, and a tmpfs since Linux 6.6). The
 * case says which it ran. */
