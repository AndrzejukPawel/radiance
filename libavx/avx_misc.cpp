/* avx_misc.cpp -- the PLE pair, the hashed n-gram ids, and the two collectives.
 *
 * Grouped because none of them is a vector kernel and the reason differs in each case, which is
 * worth saying rather than leaving as an absence:
 *
 *   ple_gate IS vectorised, in the two places that carry the work -- the per-stream norms and the
 *   gated broadcast of `v`. What is not is the dot between the two normed streams, which is
 *   accumulated in f64 because libref accumulates it in f64 and this is the one op where that
 *   choice is visible: the dot feeds a SIGNED SQUARE ROOT, which has unbounded relative sensitivity
 *   near zero, so an f32 reduction of a 10240-wide product would move the gate by more than the
 *   tolerance on exactly the rows where the gate is near its hinge.
 *
 *   ple_conv is a depthwise convolution of width 4 over a channel, which is 4 multiplies per
 *   output element with the taps `dilation` apart. The channel loop is the parallel axis and the
 *   inner one is four terms; there is no vector work in it that the outer parallelism does not
 *   already have. What it gets instead is the rolling-window rule written out exactly.
 *
 *   ngram_ids is INTEGER HASHING with a data-dependent early cut, and its arithmetic is defined by
 *   torch's -- a wrapping 64-bit multiply and a FLOORING modulo, neither of which is C's. There is
 *   nothing here to vectorise and a great deal to get exactly right.
 *
 *   all_reduce / all_gather serve WORLD SIZE 1 and refuse anything wider by name. See the note on
 *   the collectives below; it is a deliberate limit, not an omission.

/* ================================================================== the collectives
 *
 * WORLD SIZE 1 ONLY, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE LIMIT RATHER THAN AN OMISSION.
 *
 * libref implements the real thing, and it can because of how this engine is shaped: one process,
 * one thread per rank, one address space, so a peer's buffer is a POINTER and the whole collective
 * is a rendezvous, a read of every rank's pointer, and a second rendezvous before anyone
 * overwrites theirs. That makes the host backend a fake multi-device backend, which is genuinely
 * useful -- the sharded declare, the collective placement and the distributed top-k can all be
 * exercised on a box with no second card.
 *
 * It is also a piece of SHARED MUTABLE STATE with a barrier, a generation counter and a timeout,
 * and there is exactly one of it per process. Two kernel plugins each carrying their own would be
 * two rendezvous groups for one world, and which one a rank joined would depend on which plugin
 * won selection for that op -- a deadlock that appears only when the hierarchy changes. A CPU
 * kernel library has no business owning the wire; libref already owns it and sits below this
 * plugin in the hierarchy, so a tensor-parallel host deployment resolves the collectives there and
 * everything else here.
 *
 * So: at world 1 both are the degenerate case and are served exactly. Above 1 this refuses by name
 * with RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED, which makes the selector fall through to libref's row rather than
 * producing a wrong sum.
 *
 * `exact` IS HONOURED IN ONE DIRECTION ONLY, as libref does: exact=1 gets the exact sum, and
 * exact=0 -- a caller that has declared it will accept a lossy quantised wire -- ALSO gets the
 * exact sum, because there is no wire here to quantise. Serving a lossy request exactly is safe;
 * the constraint exists so a caller who wanted exactness cannot be handed a lossy result by
 * accident, not the reverse. */
