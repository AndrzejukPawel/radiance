/* avx_gemm.cpp -- the GEMM family and the two vocabulary edges.
 *
 *     nt: C[M,N] = A[M,K] @ B[N,K]^T
 *
 * B is stored TRANSPOSED because that is the layout every weight in a transformer already has, so
 * both operands are k-contiguous and the inner loop is a DOT PRODUCT over k rather than an outer
 * product over n. That single fact decides the whole shape of this file, and it is worth being
 * explicit about what it costs, because the textbook GEMM does the opposite.
 *
 * ============================== WHY DOT PRODUCT AND NOT OUTER PRODUCT ==============================
 *
 * The classical high-performance GEMM (Goto's, and every BLAS since) packs B into panels laid out
 * so the inner loop broadcasts one A element against a VECTOR of n, accumulating C[m, n0:n0+w] in
 * registers with no horizontal reduction anywhere. It is the right shape when you may choose B's
 * layout.
 *
 * Here B's layout is given, it is k-contiguous, and a transformer weight is READ ONCE PER LAUNCH --
 * there is no second GEMM against the same weight to amortise a pack over. Packing B into n-major
 * panels would mean touching the largest operand twice to save horizontal reductions that only
 * happen once per output element. At decode (M = 1) the whole GEMM is a matvec: the weight is
 * streamed exactly once, the arithmetic intensity is 2 flops a byte, and nothing about the
 * instruction mix matters because the memory system is the wall. At prefill the register blocking
 * below recovers most of what a packed form would give.
 *
 * So: REGISTER-BLOCKED DOT PRODUCT. MR rows of A against NR rows of B, MR*NR vector accumulators
 * live across the whole k loop, MR + NR vector loads per k step, and the horizontal reduction paid
 * once per output element rather than once per k step.
 *
 * ============================== THE BLOCK SIZE IS THE REGISTER FILE, AND IT WAS SWEPT ==============================
 *
 * MEASURED, gemm_nt bf16 at M=512, N=2048, K=2048, one thread, on the part libavx/README.md names:
 *
 *   AVX-512, 32 ZMM         4x4  23.2 ms      4x6  22.1 ms  <-- chosen
 *                           6x4  24.2 ms      6x6  24.0 ms
 *                           8x4  23.8 ms      8x2  35.2 ms      12x2  34.1 ms
 *   AVX2/AVX, 16 YMM        3x3  34.4 ms      2x6  30.7 ms  <-- chosen
 *                           2x5  31.9 ms      2x4  34.8 ms      2x3  40.5 ms
 *                           3x4  58.4 ms      4x3  58.1 ms
 *
 * TWO THINGS IN THAT TABLE ARE WORTH MORE THAN THE CHOICE. The first is the cliff: 3x4 and 4x3 at
 * AVX2 are 58 ms against 31-34 for everything around them, because 12 accumulators plus 3 or 4 A
 * vectors plus one B vector is 16 or 17 live in a 16-register file -- the spill lands INSIDE the k
 * loop and costs 1.9x. That is why this is written out per level rather than derived from a
 * formula, and why the numbers sit next to the code.
 *
 * The second is that WIDER IN N BEAT WIDER IN M at both levels, at equal arithmetic intensity:
 * 2x6 and 3x3 both load 8 vectors for 12 and 9 FMAs respectively -- intensity 1.5 either way -- and
 * 2x6 is 11% faster. The B vector is loaded once and reused across the MR inner iterations, so a
 * small MR keeps fewer values live and schedules better. Nothing about the flop count predicts
 * this; it came out of the sweep.
 *
 * scalar stays 2x2, where "vector" is one float and the blocking only helps the load/store
 * scheduler.
 *
 * ============================== ONE MICROKERNEL, NOT TWENTY-EIGHT ==============================
 *
 * libref templates its inner loop on (A dtype, B dtype) and selects through a function pointer,
 * because for it the per-element dtype switch WOULD be the cost -- one element is read per FLOP.
 * That is 16 instantiations for the plain family and 28 for the quantised one.
 *
 * This plugin instead PACKS TO f32 and has ONE microkernel:
 *
 *     A is widened once into a contiguous [M, K] f32 buffer   -- M*K conversions
 *     each B row is widened once, per n-block, into a thread-local buffer  -- N*K conversions
 *
 * The conversion count is the same as the fused form's (every element of both operands is
 * converted exactly once either way); what it buys is that W4, W2, MXFP4, fp8 and i8 all arrive at
 * the same code, so the packed-nibble unpack is written once (avx_support.cpp) and the microkernel
 * never sees a dtype. 28 instantiations x 4 ISA levels of hand-written vector code is not a
 * maintainable object, and the ones nobody runs would be the ones that are wrong.
 *
 * What it costs is an L1 round trip: the packed rows are written and read back. Against an operand
 * that came from L2 or DRAM -- which a weight always did -- that is not measurable, and the
 * exception is stated where it happens (an f32 contiguous A is used in place, unpacked).
 *
 * THE MEMORY THIS COSTS IS BOUNDED BY THE M BLOCK below -- the pack is MB*K floats, not M*K -- and
 * it is not blocked over K. That is a deliberate omission: K-blocking would bound the pack further
 * but would force the C accumulator into memory, because the k reduction could then no longer live
 * in registers across the whole launch. C is M*N floats, larger than the pack at every shape this
 * plugin sees, and another pass over it.
 *
 * ============================== PARALLELISM IS OVER N ==============================
 *
 * A decode step is M = 1 and a verify step is M <= 64, so an M-major split leaves all but one core
 * idle on exactly the shape the engine spends its life in. N is thousands in every GEMM a
 * transformer issues. libref made the same choice for the same reason. Each thread owns whole
 * output elements, so the summation order does not depend on the thread count and two runs at
 * different loads are bit-identical.

     * (2.85 ms unblocked against 2.91 at 256 KiB), because there the block splits a batch that did
     * not need splitting and B gets packed twice.
     *
     * THE REASON IS THE PART. The measurement above comes from one with 128 MiB of L3, where the
     * 4 MiB A panel never leaves cache however many times it is walked -- so the traffic the
     * blocking removes is served at L3 bandwidth and not DRAM's. On a part with a 32 MiB L3

 * AVX-512 the table has no in-register form (vpshufb indexes 16 bytes and a gather issues one load
 * a lane, the null result in README.md), so those levels look a code up at a time.
 *
 * EVERY ROW IS A CACHE MISS, so each row's lines are requested kAhead rows before its decode:
