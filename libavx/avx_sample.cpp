/* avx_sample.cpp -- the sampler ops.
 *
 * ============================== THESE ARE NOT WHERE THE TIME GOES, EXCEPT WHERE THEY ARE ==============================
 *
 * Eleven of these twelve ops work over a CANDIDATE SET of a thousand entries at most, and their
 * cost is control flow rather than arithmetic. Vectorising them would be work spent where no time
 * is; what they get here is the one thing that does matter -- the candidate values widened once
 * into f32 so the per-element dtype switch is gone -- and otherwise the reference's structure,
 * which is legible and provably right.
 *
 * The exceptions are the three that touch the WHOLE VOCABULARY, and at a 248K vocabulary that is a
 * megabyte a row:
 *
 *   sample_temp     a row multiply. Pure vector work, and the trivial one.
 *   sample_argmax   a maximum with the LOWEST index on a tie. Vectorised through the same
 *                   `topk_next_f32` the routers use, so the greedy path and a top-1 path cannot
 *                   disagree about a tie -- which they must not, because a greedy request is
 *                   staged at top_k = 1 when lm_head is vocab-sharded.
 *   sample_mask     a bitmask over the vocabulary. This one has an AVX-512 form that is not
 *                   available below it and is worth the `#if`: the mask word IS a `__mmask16`,
 *                   so applying 16 tokens of grammar is one masked store of -inf and no shifts at
 *                   all. Below AVX-512 it is a shift and a test per token.
 *
 * ============================== EVERY SCALAR IS PER ROW ==============================
 *
 * `rep`, `freq`, `pres`, `k`, `p`, the seed and the position are FIELDS OF A ROW (abi/rad_sample.h),
 * not parameters. A parameter is geometry -- frozen at declare, matched on by the selector -- so
 * two requests in one batch with different top_p would be two resolutions of one op and a
 * deployment would have exactly one top_p, which is not a sampler.
 *
 * ============================== THE CANDIDATE SET ==============================
 *
 * `sample_topk` produces a FIXED-WIDTH set and the narrowing stages work IN PLACE. The tensors do
 * not shrink, so a dropped candidate needs a spelling: index -1, value -infinity. Kept candidates
 * stay where they are, in descending order.
 *
 * `cand_val` carries LOGITS, not probabilities, and each narrowing stage takes its own softmax over
 * the set -- which is what llama.cpp does and what keeps the stages composable in any order.
 *
 * A GREEDY ROW (RAD_SP_GREEDY) HAS NO CANDIDATES: its token is sample_argmax's, top-k and the
 * merge write it an empty set, the narrowing stages leave it alone and the pick does not touch its
 * token -- libref's contract, for the reason given there.

/* ================================================================== dflash_select
 *
 * Not a sampler, and here because it is the other op that picks TOKENS: DFlash2's greedy walk over
 * a candidate lattice. A block-diffusion drafter proposes every position of a block in one pass, so
 * it cannot condition position l+1 on its pick at l; this puts that dependence back.
 *
 *   score[l, c] = unary[l, c] + sum_r pred[pid(l)][r] * hp[l][r] * succ[cand[l, c]][r]
 *   pid(0) = anchor[s * anchor_stride],   pid(l) = cand[l - 1, chosen(l - 1)]
 *
 * `hp` ABSENT IS A PLANE OF ONES -- a plain low-rank bigram. The walk is SERIAL IN l, since the
 * predecessor is not known until the previous step is decided, so the parallel axis is the
 * sequence and the vector work is the rank-R dot a candidate costs. A predecessor or a candidate
 * outside the vocabulary contributes nothing rather than reading past a codebook; the highest
 * score wins and a tie goes to the lower candidate, libref's rule. */
