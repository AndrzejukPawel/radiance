/* avx_isa.h -- what this machine can execute, and the one list of ops the whole plugin is built
 * around.
 *
 * ============================== WHY A DISPATCH AT ALL ==============================
 *
 * A kernel plugin is a shared object the engine dlopens (spec.md §2). It is shipped, copied,
 * copied and run on machines nobody compiled it on, so `-march=native` is not an option here even
 * though it is the obvious one: a binary built with it on an AVX-512 part SIGILLs on the first
 * vmovdqu64 anywhere older, and the failure is a signal rather than a diagnostic. The
 * alternative -- compile everything baseline -- gives up most of the machine: an AVX-512 rmsnorm
 * moves 64 bytes a cycle where the SSE2 one moves 16.
 *
 * So: the kernels are compiled ONCE PER ISA LEVEL into separate objects, each with its own
 * -m flags, and ONE baseline-compiled translation unit (avx_dispatch.cpp) picks between them at
 * load. Nothing outside those per-level objects may contain an instruction above the baseline,
 * which is why the dispatcher, the registry and the schemas are all in files with no -m flags on
 * them: a single stray intrinsic in the registry would fault before the dispatch ever ran.
 *
 * ============================== THE FOUR LEVELS ==============================
 *
 *   AVX_LEVEL_SCALAR (0)  x86-64 baseline. SSE2 exists on every x86-64 and the compiler uses it
 *                         for scalar float, but nothing here is hand-vectorised. ALWAYS CORRECT,
 *                         always selectable, and the answer every other level is checked against.
 *   AVX_LEVEL_AVX    (1)  AVX. 256-bit FLOAT only -- Sandy/Ivy Bridge have no 256-bit integer
 *                         ALU and no FMA, so the bf16<->f32 conversions in avx_vec.h split into
 *                         two 128-bit halves and every a*b+c is a separate mul and add.
 *   AVX_LEVEL_AVX2   (2)  AVX2 + FMA + F16C. 256-bit integer, vpermd/vpgatherdd, hardware f16.
 *                         This is the level almost every x86 machine made since 2013 runs.
 *   AVX_LEVEL_AVX512 (3)  AVX-512 F/BW/DQ/VL. 512-bit, and -- what actually matters more than the
 *                         width -- 32 architectural vector registers instead of 16, which is what
 *                         lets the GEMM microkernel hold a 12x2 accumulator block in registers,
 *                         and write masks, which remove the scalar tail loop from every op.
 *
 * AVX-512 IS NOT ONE FEATURE and the check has to be the conjunction: a Knights Landing has F but
 * not BW/DQ/VL, and a kernel that tested `avx512f` alone and then used a byte shuffle would fault
 * on it. __builtin_cpu_supports is used rather than raw CPUID because it also consults XGETBV --
 * a CPU may enumerate AVX-512 while the OS has not enabled the ZMM state, and using it then
 * faults. Missing that check is the single most common way a hand-rolled CPUID dispatch is wrong.
 *
 * ============================== THE OP LIST IS A MACRO ==============================
 *
 * AVX_OP_LIST below is the only place the op set is written down. It generates the dispatch table
 * struct, the four extern table declarations, the baseline thunks the registry rows point at, and
 * the harness's op enumeration. Adding an op means adding one line here and one definition per
 * level; forgetting either is a link error rather than a row that silently resolves to null.
 * libref uses the same technique for its shape hooks (`fn ## _shape`, libref/ref_ops.h).
