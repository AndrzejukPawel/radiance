/* avx_hc.cpp -- the GATED RESIDUAL pair and the MTP head's entry.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT THE GATED RESIDUAL IS ==============================
 *
 * Qwen4-Exp's replacement for a pre-norm and a residual add. The residual stream is `hc` times as
 * wide as the model -- hidden 2560 at hc 4 is a 10240-wide stream carried through every layer,
 * entered as hc identical copies of the embedding and collapsed once at the end. Every block reads
 * a 2560 mix of the four and writes its output back into all four, and BOTH the read's mix and the
 * write's per-stream gain are data-dependent, which is what "gated" means here.
 *
 *   hc_read    N       = grouped_rmsnorm(h)              one rsqrt per n-wide stream, one gain of
 *                                                        hc*n over all of them, `1 + w`
 *              g       = sigmoid(W_up @ silu(W_down @ N / hc))
 *              x       = mean_over_streams(g * N)
 *              inj[s]  = 2 * sigmoid(W_inj[s] . N / hc)
 *   hc_write   h[s]   += inj[s] * y
 *
 * THREE FACTS THAT ARE NOT DERIVABLE FROM THE OTHERS, and a second implementation has to match all
 * three (docs/OPS.md states them and they are restated here because each is a silent failure):
 *
 *   THE WRITE READS THE UNNORMED `h`, NOT `N`. The normalisation is consumed by the block input
 *   and the gates and never enters the stream. Writing into `N` instead re-normalises the residual
 *   at every one of 96 connections, diverges within a few layers, and still produces fluent text.
 *
 *   THE MIX IS A MEAN, NOT A SUM -- `.mean(dim=-2)` over the hc dimension.
 *
 *   THERE IS A SEPARATE `/ hc` INSIDE EACH GATE ARGUMENT, before the silu and before the inject
 *   sigmoid. Three divisions by hc in total, none implied by the others.
 *
 * ============================== THE ROUNDING IS PART OF THE OP ==============================
 *
 * The arithmetic here is f32, but the REFERENCE MODEL's is not: torch's grouped norm returns
 * `.type_as(x)`, so both matrix products and the final multiply read a bf16 `N`. libref rounds
 * once per element for that reason and so does this -- through the row converter rather than
 * element by element, which is the same value and one pass. The same applies to the silu output,
 * the sigmoid gate, and to `x` before the optional fp8 quantiser reads it back.
 *
 * ============================== THE WEIGHTS ARE WIDENED ONCE PER LAUNCH ==============================
 *
 * This is the structural change from libref, and it is worth more here than vectorisation. Every
 * product below contracts a WEIGHT against a per-token vector -- `down` is [lowrank, hc*n], `up` is
 * [hc*n, lowrank], `inject_w` is [hc, hc*n] -- and libref reads those weights through `ldt` inside
 * the token loop, so a 2048-row prefill chunk converts the same 10240-wide weight row 2048 times.
 * Widening all three into one scratch block before the token loop makes every dot product a
 * straight f32 vector reduction and converts each weight element exactly once.
 *
 * ONE scratch_raw CALL FOR ALL OF THEM, because the arena grows: a second call at a larger size
 * frees the first block, and every worker thread would then be reading a dangling weight.

 *
 * THE MULTI-TOKEN-PREDICTION HEAD'S ENTRY, for a model whose residual stream is `hc` wide.
 *
 * A pre-norm MTP head joins the trunk's hidden state and the next token's embedding with ONE `fc`
 * over their concatenation. Qwen4-Exp's cannot: its hidden state is the WIDE stream and the
 * checkpoint carries TWO square matrices, so the hidden half is `fc_h` applied to EACH of the hc
 * sub-streams and the embedding half is one n-wide product added into all of them.
 *
 *     ne[j]     = e[j] * rsqrt(mean(e^2) + eps) * (w_e[j] + wadd)
 *     fe[i]     = sum_j fc_e[i][j] * ne[j]
 *     nh[k][j]  = h[k*n+j] * rs[k] * (w_h[k*n+j] + wadd)
 *     x[k*n+i]  = sum_j fc_h[i][j] * nh[k][j] + fe[i]
 *
 * `ngroup` IS THE ONE THING THE CHECKPOINT DOES NOT SAY: a [hc*n] gain fits both a grouped norm
 * (hc rsqrts) and a flat one (a single rsqrt over the wide row). Both are self-consistent and no
 * per-op oracle can tell them apart; the cheap empirical answer is the draft acceptance rate, so
 * the choice is carried as a parameter and asked once at declare.
 *
 * ============================== IT IS A GEMM AND IS RUN AS ONE ==============================
 *
 * libref computes this token by token, converting `fc_h` and `fc_e` out of their stored dtype
 * inside the innermost loop -- so an [n, n] weight is converted `rows * hc` times. Restructured
 * here as what it is: the norms are materialised into a PANEL first ([rows*hc, n] for the hidden
 * half, [rows, n] for the embedding), and then the loop runs over the OUTPUT COLUMN i, packing
 * `fc_h` row i and `fc_e` row i once and contracting them against every panel row.
 *
 * That is the same choice avx_gemm.cpp makes and for the same reason -- but note what it does NOT
 * do: it does not pre-widen the whole [n, n] weight, which at n = 2560 would be 26 MiB per matrix.
 * One row at a time, thread-local, is bounded by n floats and the weight is still read exactly
 * once. The panel is the thing that had to be materialised, and it is rows*hc*n -- 328 KiB on a
 * draft round, which is what this op is for.
