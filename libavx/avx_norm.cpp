/* avx_norm.cpp -- rmsnorm, rmsnorm_add and layernorm.
 *
 * ============================== ONE PASS OVER THE ROW, TWICE ==============================
 *
 * Every norm here is a REDUCTION followed by a SCALE, which means two passes over the row and no
 * way around it: the scale needs a number the whole row contributed to. What can be avoided is
 * paying for the dtype conversion twice, and that is the shape of every kernel below -- convert
 * the row to f32 ONCE into scratch, reduce out of scratch, scale out of scratch. libref converts
 * per element and therefore converts each element three times in rmsnorm_add.
 *
 * The reduction itself is `row_sumsq` (avx_support.cpp), which is a four-accumulator vector tree.
 * That does NOT sum in libref's ascending-index order, and it is the whole reason the bf16
 * tolerance for a norm is 4e-3 rather than zero. Stated here because it is the one thing about
 * these kernels that a reader should not have to derive: the arithmetic is the same, the ORDER is
 * not, and the order is what a tolerance is for.
 *
 * ============================== THE TWO ROUNDING CONTRACTS ==============================
 *
 * `wadd` is GemmaRMSNorm's `1 +`, and it is added to the weight in f32 AFTER the weight has been
 * widened -- never to the stored bf16 gain. Qwen3.5, Qwen3-Next and Gemma all store a zero-centred
 * gain, and forming `1 + w` in bf16 first loses 0.3% per channel. libr4d's fused norms say the
 * same thing; this is the third implementation of that sentence and they agree.
 *
 * `rmsnorm_add` takes the variance from the UNROUNDED f32 sum and the multiply from the sum AFTER
 * it has been narrowed into residual_out. That asymmetry is not an accident of libref's loop: it
 * is what vLLM's fused_add_rms_norm does, because the residual has to be stored anyway and
 * re-reading it is free, and every fused kernel in this project will do it. An implementation that
 * kept f32 throughout would be half an ulp better and would fail against every kernel it is meant
 * to certify.

 * WHY THIS IS WORTH ITS OWN BUFFER: `w` is the same n elements for every one of `rows` rows, so
 * converting it inside the row loop converts it `rows` times -- at a 4096-wide bf16 gain and a
 * 2048-token prefill chunk that is 8 M pointless conversions. It cannot go in the thread_local
 * scratch, because every thread needs it and they would each build their own; it is built once
 * into a caller-provided buffer before the parallel region and read by all of them.
 *
 * `wadd` is folded in HERE, which is also where it is cheapest: once per element of the gain,
