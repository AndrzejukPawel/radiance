/* avx_rows.h -- the quantised embedding gather's two halves: the row source, compiled once at the
 * baseline, and the row decode, compiled per ISA level.
 *
 * embed_lookup_q over an E4M3 table into bf16 is a gather of rows that are, most of the time, not in
 * memory at all: the n-gram table it exists for is tens of gigabytes in a container that is mapped
 * and never loaded. Getting the bytes is the whole cost and is the same work at every ISA level --
 * a row cache every thread shares, direct reads for its misses, a reader thread that runs a step
 * ahead -- so that half is avx_ngram.cpp, compiled baseline, with one row cache for the process
 * whatever level runs. Turning a row's codes into bf16 is the half that differs per level, so the
 * level's kernel hands its own decoder in. */
