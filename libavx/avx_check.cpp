/* avx_check.cpp -- rad-avx-check: libavx against libref, every op, every ISA level, no engine.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT THIS IS AND WHY IT IS NOT rad-kbench ==============================
 *
 * rad-kbench is the tree's kernel checker and it is the right tool for a DEVICE plugin: it needs
 * rad_core, a Geometry, a plugin loader and (for the fixture path) a recorded artifact. Building
 * it means building the engine, which on a machine with no device toolchain means building the
 * engine's host half to test a host plugin. This is the same comparison with nothing under it: two dlopen calls, a
 * table of geometries, and libref's own operand descriptions to size the buffers.
 *
 * It links NEITHER plugin. That is not laziness -- the claim being made is about the .so the
 * engine would load, and a checker that statically linked the kernels would be exercising a
 * different binary with different inlining and different flags.
 *
 * ============================== THE FOUR THINGS IT CHECKS, IN ORDER ==============================
 *
 *   1. SCHEMA AGREEMENT, before any arithmetic. The loader refuses two plugins whose schemas for
 *      one op disagree, and it refuses the WHOLE plugin -- so a single drifted parameter makes
 *      every row libavx carries unreachable, and the message an operator sees names one op and
 *      leaves them to find the rest. libavx's schema table is a hand-kept copy of libref's
 *      (avx_registry.cpp says so at length); this is what keeps the copy honest, running the
 *      loader's own rule: parameter key/type/requiredness positionally, operand role/optionality
 *      positionally, names deliberately NOT compared.
 *
 *   2. COVERAGE. Every op libref implements, libavx must implement. A row that is ABSENT and a row
 *      that RETURNS RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED are reported differently and neither is reported as a pass.
 *      This is the check that catches a kernel that was built and never wired, because a kernel
 *      that declines is indistinguishable from a kernel that works to anything that only looks for
 *      the return codes it expects.
 *
 *   3. THE NUMBERS. Both plugins are handed BYTE-IDENTICAL inputs and every OUT and INOUT operand
 *      is compared. The FINITENESS PATTERN is compared first and separately: a NaN on one side and
 *      a number on the other is a failure, not a tolerance question, and the obvious spelling
 *      (`rel > tol || rel < 0`) is FALSE for NaN -- which is how a NaN passes a comparison
 *      silently. After the geometry table, a set of HAND-BUILT cases covers the operand shapes a
 *      description cannot draw -- strided column slices, several sequences, rolling windows read
 *      past offset zero, a band above the operand's rows (see hand_cases below).
 *
 *   4. EVERY ISA LEVEL. The scalar, AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 paths are four instruction streams
 *      compiled from one source, and only the level the machine under it happens to execute gets
 *      exercised by accident. Each is forced in turn through avx_isa_force -- an exported
 *      symbol rather than an environment variable, because an env switch that changes what a
 *      kernel computes is exactly what this project refuses to have. A level the CPU cannot
 *      execute is reported as NOT EXECUTABLE and counted nowhere: claiming a pass for a path that
 *      never ran is the one result worse than a failure.

/* ================================================================== exhaustive conversion
 *
 * THE ONE CHECK A DRAW CANNOT MAKE. Every geometry in the case table fills its operands with
 * standard normals, which is the right domain for an activation and reaches almost none of the
 * interesting bit patterns of a narrow float: no NaN, no infinity, no subnormal, no negative zero.
 * A conversion is exactly where those live -- `cvt_fp8e4m3_to_f32` has a separate branch for the
 * subnormal range and another for the format's single NaN encoding, and a draw of normals exercises
 * neither.
 *
 * So the 8-bit and 16-bit formats are checked EXHAUSTIVELY: every one of the 256 or 65536 bit
 * patterns, through the plugin's own `cast`, against libref's. For an 8-bit source that is the
 * complete input space and the result is a proof rather than evidence; for a 16-bit one it is the
 * complete space too. The narrowing direction (f32 -> narrow) cannot be exhaustive over 2^32, so it
 * is fed the widened patterns back plus the boundary values of each format -- which is where a
 * narrowing rounds differently if it is going to.
 *
 * It is worth the forty lines because this is the class of bug that survives everything else: the
 * fp8 encode's lower bound was wrong by seven octaves and every geometry in the table still passed
 * until `cast` was run at a tolerance of 1e-6. */
