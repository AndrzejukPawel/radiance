/* media.h -- turning the bytes of an image or a video into RGB frames (spec §11).
 *
 * ONE DECODER FOR BOTH, and it is libavformat/libavcodec. An image is a one-frame stream to it, so
 * PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, BMP and TIFF arrive through the same demuxer probe and the same decode loop
 * a video takes, and there is one colour conversion (libswscale) rather than one per format. A
 * build without the libraries has no decoder at all: every call here returns RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED
 * with the reason, and the server refuses a media part by name rather than guessing at its bytes.
 *
 * THE BYTES COME FROM THE REQUEST, never from a URL. The server accepts `data:` URLs only, so
 * nothing here opens a file or a network stream: the demuxer reads a memory buffer through its own
 * I/O context, and the protocol whitelist is empty.
 *
 * WHAT A FRAME IS: packed 8-bit RGB, row-major, no padding. An alpha channel is DROPPED, not
 * composited -- the reference processor converts with PIL's convert("RGB"), which does the same,
 * so a transparent PNG reaches the encoder with the colours under its alpha.
