/* processor.h -- what an image or a video becomes before an encoder sees it (spec §11).
 *
 * THIS IS THE QWEN-VL PROCESSOR FAMILY (Qwen2-VL through Qwen3.x), and what is family-specific is
 * the arithmetic, not the numbers: every size, rate and token id comes from the container, which
 * carries the checkpoint's config.json and its two preprocessor configs (rad-convert writes them
 * under `vision_config.*`, `preprocessor.*` and `video_preprocessor.*`). What the family fixes:
 *
 *   - A picture is resized so both sides are multiples of patch * merge and its area falls in the
 *     configured band, keeping the aspect ratio (smart_resize), with PIL's antialiased bicubic.
 *   - It is cut into patch x patch squares, `temporal` frames deep -- an image is repeated to fill
 *     the depth -- in MERGE-BLOCK ORDER: the merge x merge patches that become one output row are
 *     consecutive. Each patch row is (channel, frame, y, x), normalised by the configured mean and
 *     deviation, in bf16.
 *   - The prompt gets `<vision_start> pad*N <vision_end>` where the template put the media, N
 *     being the encoder's output rows. A video gets one such run per temporal group, each after
 *     the text `<T seconds>` giving the group's time -- which is how the model knows when a frame
 *     is, since the groups share one temporal rotary component.
 *   - Rotary positions are three components (temporal, height, width): text counts up in all
 *     three; a media run holds its start in the first and adds its row and column to the other
 *     two; the text after it continues from start + max(rows, cols). (RopeLayout below.)
 *
 * The encoder's input is patches plus each patch's (row, col) in its segment and the segment's
 * size, which is all a learned position table and a 2-D rotary embedding need; the processor
 * produces those too, so the core stages them without knowing what they are for.
