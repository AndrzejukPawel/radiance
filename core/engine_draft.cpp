/* engine_draft.cpp -- the two drafter drivers (spec §10).
 *
 * A draft head runs as EXTRA PASSES after the trunk step has been sampled and committed, and
 * there are two shapes of it: SERIAL runs `depth` dependent passes, BLOCK runs a context pass and
 * then one pass that fills the whole block. Which one this program has is what the architecture

 *
 * Split out of the step loop's file because both drivers are the same idea from the loop's point

 *
 * `RAD_DRAFT_SERIAL`: one forward pass of the head per drafted token, after the trunk step. Round 1
 * consumes the token the sampler chose and the hidden state of the position that token came from,
 * and which position that is depends on how many drafts the verify accepted. Its pass is the
 * history pass, which the head runs anyway and whose rows already include that position
 * (RadBatch::draft_out_ids).
 *
 * THE CARD DECIDES THAT, NOT THE HOST (sched/advance.h). Behind the trunk's sampler every rank
 * runs the acceptance itself and keeps what it implies in its StepSlots; every draft pass is then
 * staged with its positions and tokens left to the card, and an advance in front of the pass fills
 * them in. So the host issues the whole step -- trunk, history, every round -- without waiting for
 * any of it, and reads the step back once, after the last round. Reading the sampled ids back and
 * staging round 1 from them instead would leave the card idle for a wake, a readback, a commit and
 * a batch build on every step.
 *
 * Every pass is an ordinary step: a RadBatch run through the same barrier and the same sampler
 * chain. What makes it a draft pass is `draft_pass`, which the architecture plugin reads to run
 * the head instead of the trunk.
 *
 * The tokens go out through set_draft(), the same door the prompt-lookup drafter uses, so the
 * next step cannot tell them apart -- and a sequence the head declined leaves n_draft at 0,
 * which is exactly the case where the n-gram drafter gets its turn.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE NAMES A MODEL. An MTP head has this shape, and an EAGLE or Medusa head declares
 * RAD_DRAFT_SERIAL and runs on it unchanged.

 * there are no rounds to chain. `block` is the drafter's own (it is `depth + 1` when the anchor

 *
 * What there is instead is TWO passes with different shapes, and the split is what a
 * block-diffusion architecture asks for:
 *
 *   THE CONTEXT PASS mirrors the trunk step that just ran. The drafter reads the trunk's tapped
 *   hidden states, projects them, and stores K and V for those positions in a cache of its own --
 *   so it runs over exactly the rows the trunk produced, in exactly that order.
 *
 *   THE QUERY PASS runs the drafter's own layers over the block and fills every masked position.
 *   The tokens land in the buffer the plugin named as `proposal` -- not in the sampler's, because
 *   what chooses here is the drafter's own selector and it is not a sampler. That is why
 *   RAD_DRAFT_BLOCK requires a proposal buffer and RAD_DRAFT_SERIAL does not.
 *
 * They go out through set_draft() like every other proposal, so nothing downstream can tell a
