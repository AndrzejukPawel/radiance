/* ctx.h -- the run phase. Ordinary C++ with one rule: it may only issue handles obtained during
 * declare (spec §3.2). Nothing else is constrained, and its whole job is to be cheap.
 *
 * Everything expensive already happened. Declare resolved every op against the kernel hierarchy
 * per band and per domain, the buffer plan sized one arena for the worst step, and the planner
 * assigned every weight a tier and a site. What is left for a step is: index a bucket table with
 * an integer, copy a tensor template per operand, patch in the pointers, and launch. The per-issue
 * work is filling a struct we already own, not constructing one.
 *
 * COST. An issue is single-digit nanoseconds. Nearly all of it is the RadTensor template copies at
 * 112 bytes each; the band scan is one or two compares off a cache line and the RadArgs patch is a
 * single store. tests/runtime_test.cpp times it and prints it, so the number is checkable rather
 * than claimed, and it is a tripwire -- a hundredfold miss means somebody put an allocation or a
 * map lookup back on this path.
 *
 * At a 64-layer model issuing ~20 ops a layer that is ~1280 issues, so order ten microseconds of
 * CORE time per decode step. Spec §3.2 accepts roughly 1-2 ms of launch overhead per step at 64
 * layers; the rest of that budget is the driver's own per-launch dispatch cost -- order 1 us per
 * hipLaunchKernel, which is what 1280 launches actually costs -- and it is not ours to spend. It is
 * also what HIP-graph capture would attack if v1 wanted it, which §3.2 says is a change to that
 * section and not to the ABI. The core is therefore not where the step budget goes, against a
 * Python engine's 10-20 ms of the same thing.
 *
 * A residency table with a pending event adds one rad_event_wait -- once per weight per
 * GENERATION, not per issue, which is why residency.h makes the mover bump it.

 * these runs before the step is issued and every issue path returns immediately, so on a long
 * prefill chunk -- most of a second of device time -- the host reaches the end of the prompt while
 * the card is still on its first chunks. With two banks, the copy for step S is overwritten by the
 * one for S+2 long before the device has reached either, the freshest bank always holds a copy in
 * flight, and the engine skips the layer: over 41 chunks of 2048 tokens, two banks credit 79
 * layer-histograms and skip 3800 as not yet landed.
 *
 * THE BYTES ARE NOT THE PROBLEM -- the device does execute every copy, in order, spread over its
 * own progress. A shallow ring overwrites them before anyone reads them. A ring as deep as the
 * run-ahead keeps each one until it is credited, and the dispatch drains every landed bank rather
 * than only the newest, so a burst of host steps followed by a wait still credits every histogram
 * the card produced in between.
 *
 * DEPTH IS A MEMORY-FOR-EVIDENCE TRADE AND IT IS CHEAP: one int32 an expert a bank a layer, which
 * on a 49-layer 254-expert plane is about 50 KiB a bank. What it cannot do is exceed the run-ahead

     * not touch costs its step a flag test.
     *
     * TRUSTED ONLY AFTER IT IS CHECKED. A key is recorded the second time it is seen, recorded
     * again and compared the third, and only then played; a played tape is compared against a

     * throughput. Nothing else may use it without reading the three constraints below.
     *
     * ONE: EVERY COLLECTIVE MUST RIDE THE SAME LANE. The all-reduce carries a per-block `seq`
     * counter and double-buffers its scratch on `seq & 1`, so two launches that race differently
     * on the two ranks would pick DIFFERENT slots for the same message and deadlock or corrupt.
     * Both ranks run the same architecture code, so putting every all-reduce on lane 1 keeps them
     * ordered against each other and therefore identically numbered on both ranks. Splitting the
     * collectives ACROSS lanes is the bug this comment exists to prevent.
     *
     * TWO: A DEVICE-WIDE ARRIVAL COUNTER MUST BE KEYED ON THE STREAM. `split_ctr` in
     * r4d_gemm_fp8a8.hip is the split-K finisher's counter, self-resetting, and it is sound only
     * because two launches of this kernel never overlap -- they are ordered by the same stream.
     * One counter block for the whole device would hold only with one compute stream a rank; a
     * second lane running a narrow GEMM beside one on lane 0 breaks it. There is therefore one
     * counter block a STREAM, so ordering does the work again -- and any OTHER plugin kernel with
     * a device-wide counter has to do the same or stay off lane 1, because nothing here can check
     * it.
     *
     * THREE: THE BUFFER PLANNER PACKS FROM ONE LINEAR ORDER. Two lanes can therefore write the
     * same arena bytes through two buffers whose declared lifetimes do not overlap. The
     * architecture names the buffers its second lane touches to `rad_buf_concurrent`, which hands
     * each of them the whole program -- a few MiB for one block's transients.
     *
     * FOUR: A SLICE MUST LAND IN THE SAME BUCKET-TABLE BAND AS THE WHOLE. This is the one that
     * would silently change the model's output rather than break it. An op's kernel is chosen by
     * which band `n` falls in, and `--debug-graph` prints the boundaries a model actually has.
     * They are sparse and uneven -- a representative set is
     *
     *     8   16   56   64   256   1024   4096   8192   16384   49152   65536
     *
     * so a 4096-token chunk cut in HALF gives 2048 and 2048, both inside (1024, 4096] and both
     * resolving to the same kernel -- while cutting it in FOUR gives 1024, which is the TOP of the
     * band below and picks a different kernel with a different summation order. The ragged last
     * chunk of a prompt is worse: 16449 tokens is four full chunks and then 65, and halving 65
     * crosses the boundaries at 64 and 56. So the rule a pipelined path must obey is that every
     * slice sits strictly above the largest boundary below T, which at a 4096-token chunk means
     * TWO slices and no more.
     *
     * The T-dependent selections inside the architecture hold at two slices: `ar_wire_is_exact`
     * only flips below T = 13 (`numel * 2 < wire_min_bytes`), and the gated-GEMM fold and the
     * fused attention prologue both band at T <= 64.
     *
     * WHAT MAKES ALL OF THIS WORTH IT: a many-block SPINNING kernel on one stream does not starve
     * a bandwidth-bound kernel on another. The all-reduce launches min(M, 256) blocks that spin on
     * a peer flag while the fabric drains, and if those held their CUs there would be nothing to
     * overlap with. Run a dependent-FMA spinner and a large copy on two streams and the pair costs
     * the MAX of the two rather than the sum: the copy finishes inside the spinner's window at
     * every block count, including counts higher than the part can hold resident at once. */
