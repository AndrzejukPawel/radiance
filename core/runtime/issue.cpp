 * Per rad_issue, in order: index the op's bucket table with `n`, pick the domain from the resolved

 * built at declare, resolve every weight handle to a pointer (waiting on the mover's event on the

 * you lose by accident, so each of them is checkable here: the only writes are into arrays sized
 * at prepare, the only device call besides the launch is rad_event_wait (which orders a stream and
 * does not block the host), and nothing in this file reads a device value back.
 *
 * See ctx.h for the per-issue cost and where it sits against spec §3.2's budget.

 *
 * A draft pass costs several microseconds a dispatch where a bare `hipLaunchKernelGGL` costs
 * around one and a half (`isa/graphrate.hip` prices one). The difference has to be here, and
 * nothing else in the tree can see it: an op's host cost is invisible in a kernel trace, and the
 * per-op profiler times the DEVICE.
 *
 * `own` is everything before the launch -- the band scan, the domain lookup, the operand
 * resolution loop. `launch` is the plugin shim plus HIP. Two clock reads an issue, ~50 ns on a
 * path this says is microseconds, and only when the variable is set.
 *
 * REPORTED PER WINDOW AND NOT AS A RUNNING MEAN. Load and the first prefill put seconds into the
 * accumulator over relatively few issues, so a cumulative average decays through a series of
 * individually plausible numbers, every one of them the startup transient and none of them the
 * steady state. A statistic that is still moving after a million samples is measuring the warm-up,
 * and printing it as "us each" invites exactly the wrong conclusion. */

 * they move, every replay needs `hipGraphExecKernelNodeSetParams` over ~50 nodes, which is most of
 * the submit cost back.

     * that gap is the whole reason the issue path is allowed to cost a microsecond. A HOST-SITE op
     * is the one place it stops being harmless: it runs NOW, on this thread, and reads and writes
     * the host arena NOW.
     *
     * A PLE gather is exactly that shape. `ngram_ids` writes the hashed row ids into a host-domain
     * buffer on the device, and `embed_lookup_q` reads them on the host. With no join the host
     * reads whatever the arena holds from an earlier step and gathers the rows of the wrong
     * n-gram -- valid ids, valid rows, every kernel agreeing with its oracle, and fluent text that
     * is a stable wrong answer rather than an intermittent one.
     *
     * WHAT THE JOIN WAITS FOR is the last device op on each lane that touched the host arena
     * (host_touch_ev_), not the whole stream. Every hazard a host op has is with such an op -- the
     * producer of an input, or a device reader of bytes its output reuses -- and on one lane they
     * all complete no later than the last of them. Draining the stream instead waits for
     * everything issued before the op, which on a decode step is every layer in front of it, and
     * then the device runs dry while the host works, because nothing after the host op has been
     * issued yet. Waiting on the producer alone lets an architecture issue it early and keep the
     * device busy with the layers issued in between while the host gathers.
     *
     * AN OPERAND THE ARENA DOES NOT DESCRIBE IS NOT TRACKED -- a raw batch pointer, a KV cache, a
     * device-domain buffer -- so a host op that names one drains its stream (host_join).
     *
     * AND THE HOST'S WRITES HAVE TO REACH THE DEVICE. Host-arena memory is cached on the device like
     * any other memory, and with no host wait between the host op and the kernel that reads its
