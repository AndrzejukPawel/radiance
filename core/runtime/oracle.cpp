/* oracle.cpp -- run the HOST kernel beside the device one, on the same bytes, every issue.
 *
 * ================================================================= why this exists
 *
 * rad-kbench falsifies one op at a time against libref, with operands rad-kbench invented. A build
 * can pass nearly every configuration it knows while the engine answers the same token to every
 * prompt. That gap is structural and not a gap in coverage: rad-kbench's operands are ITS shapes, dense and
 * rank-2 and freshly filled, and the engine's are row slices of a max_tok buffer, column slices of
 * a fused projection, rank-3 views a scan kernel required, and weights that came off a file. An op
 * can be correct at every shape rad-kbench knows and wrong at the one shape the model issues.
 *
 * So this checks the shape the model actually issued. For a matching op it
 *
 *   1. copies every operand to the host BEFORE the launch -- inputs, outputs, weights, all of it;
 *   2. lets the device kernel run and synchronises;
 *   3. copies every operand back into a second host buffer;
 *   4. puts every weight the device row stores RELAID back through that row's own
 *      RadUnrelayoutFn, because the kernel rearranged it at load and a dense reference reads the
 *      canonical planes (see oracle_unrelayout -- this step is not optional, it is the
 *      difference between checking a kernel and comparing a permutation against itself);
 *   5. runs the HOST kernel for the same (op, band) on the copy from step 1 -- same RadTensor
 *      shapes, same strides, same parameters, only the pointers differ;
 *   6. compares, per operand, the host result against the device result.
 *
 * Step 5 is the part that has no substitute. The host row is libref's, resolved by the same
 * selector into the same bucket table -- `issue_table_[plan_off + band*RAD_N_DOMAINS + HOST]` is
 * already sitting there beside the device plan, filled in at prepare and never used, because the
 * placement planner put every op on the device. It is a second implementation of the op, against
 * the same schema, and it is free.
 *
 * ================================================================= what it costs
 *
 * Everything. Two device-to-host copies of every operand -- a fused gate_up weight is 170 MiB --
 * a host synchronisation per issue, and a reference kernel that is not trying to be fast. A step
 * with the oracle on takes minutes. It is a debugging instrument and it is off unless asked.
 *
 * ================================================================= how to ask
 *
 *   RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE=gemm_nt_q,rmsnorm   op names, comma separated; `*` for every op
 *   RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE_MAX=32              stop after this many checks (default 32)
 *   RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE_FROM=0              first ISSUE INDEX to consider (default 0)
 *   RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE_TO=100000           last issue index to consider
 *   RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE_TOL=0.02            relative tolerance below which an operand is silent
 *   RADIANCE_OP_ORACLE_MAXBYTES            the largest operand a check will copy (default 4 GiB)
 *
 * The issue index is the same counter Ctx tracks internally and the same order --debug-graph
 * prints, so a failure names a position in the graph and not just an op.
 *
 * ================================================================= the repeat mode
 *
 * RADIANCE_OP_REPEAT asks a different question with the same machinery: not "does this kernel
 * agree with libref" but "does this kernel agree with ITSELF". It snapshots the operands, lets
 * the device kernel run, puts the operands back exactly as they were, runs the SAME DEVICE KERNEL
 * again, and byte-compares the two results.
 *
 * That is the one fault class every other instrument here is structurally blind to. The oracle,
 * rad-kbench and the residual probe all run an op ONCE per side, so a kernel with an unordered
 * reduction, a workgroup reading what another workgroup is writing, or a workspace it assumed was
 * zeroed passes them at exactly the rate it happens to be right. Byte-exact, no tolerance: the
 * same kernel on the same bytes has no licence to move, and one mantissa bit is a different token
 * a few hundred greedy steps later.
 *
 *   RADIANCE_OP_REPEAT=*                   op names, comma separated; `*` for every op
 *   RADIANCE_OP_REPEAT_MAX=1000000         stop after this many checks
 *   RADIANCE_OP_REPEAT_FROM / _TO          issue index window
 *   RADIANCE_OP_REPEAT_MAXBYTES=8388608    operands above this are not copied, restored or
 *                                          compared -- which is what keeps a 170 MiB fused weight
 *                                          from making the mode unaffordable, and is right only
 *                                          because such an operand is read-only.
 *
 * ================================================================= what it cannot see
 *
 * An op ISSUED ON A LANE THE SNAPSHOT DOES NOT SYNCHRONISE -- fixed for lane 1, which is the only
 * one the ABI has, and a third would need the same line.
 *
 * An op with no host kernel for the band -- the oracle skips it and says so once. An op whose
 * dtype the core cannot size (a plugin-private one) -- skipped, since a byte span is the one thing
 * this needs to know. An op whose device row re-lays a weight and publishes no inverse -- skipped
 * BY NAME, because the alternative is a page of false mismatches that drowns the true ones. And
 * an op that is wrong in the SAME WAY on both sides, which is what a shared misreading of the
 * schema would look like; that is what rad-kbench's independent operands
 * are for, and the two instruments are complementary rather than redundant.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ the stored layout
 *
 * THE HOST KERNEL READS A WEIGHT CANONICALLY AND THE ENGINE DOES NOT HOLD IT THAT WAY.
 *
 * A container holds each weight's encoding as canonical planes, and the kernel that reads it may
 * rearrange them at load (spec §4.3): libr4d's fp8a8 GEMMs claim WMMA FRAGMENT ORDER, the same N*K
 * bytes permuted so a wave's sixteen rows arrive in lane order off one coalesced load. libref
 * declares no layout for anything and reads [N, K] row-major. Handing it the operand pointer
 * unchanged therefore compares two readings of one permuted plane, which are uncorrelated tensors
 * -- a relative error around 1.35 on every operand from element zero, on a kernel that is not
 * wrong.
 *
 * So the stored bytes go back through the device row's own inverse to the canonical planes, and
 * from those to the form the HOST row reads: a single plane converted element by element -- an
 * expert's int4 codes as the integers the reference multiplies -- or a whole encoding decoded by
 * the core's decoder, which is what a reference reading an lm_head of codes and scales together
 * wants. Both sides then see the same values, expressed the way each of them reads.
 *
 * NO INVERSE MEANS NO CHECK, and it is a named skip rather than a tolerance: a comparison that
 * cannot be made honestly is worse than one not made, because a page of false failures drowns the
 * true ones. Returns false in that case, and the issue is not counted as checked.
 *
 * WHICH LOGICAL FORM, AND WHO SAYS SO. `opd_shape` describes the operand the kernel is HANDED --
 * for a relayed weight that is the stored form, which is the thing being inverted and cannot also
 * be the answer. The form wanted here is the one the READER reads, so the host row is asked first
 * and the device row is the fallback. libref publishes a shape for the whole conventional
 * vocabulary, so an op inside docs/OPS.md is describable even when the kernel under test
 * describes nothing.
 *
 * The extents come from the parameters AT THIS ISSUE, not from the weight's declaration: a
 * tensor-parallel shard's op carries the per-rank N and K. */
