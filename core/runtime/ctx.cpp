 * domain from the layout claim deliberately, because libref declares no layout for anything and
 * every re-laying device kernel would otherwise collide with its own reference fallback and no
 * model would declare at all.
 *
 * So moving an op to a domain whose kernel reads its weights AS DECLARED hands that kernel a
 * plane it cannot read. libr4d stores an fp8a8 weight in WMMA fragment order -- the same N*K
 * bytes in a different arrangement -- so the byte count matches, every shape check passes, and
 * the op computes a plausible wrong answer for the life of the process. Two readings of one
 * permuted plane are uncorrelated tensors, which is a model that serves and lies.
 *
 * The load-time tag check in engine_bringup cannot see this: it compares the container against
 * the tag the claimant recorded, and both of those are the device row's. This asks the same
 * question of the kernel that will actually run.
 *
 * `why` gets the sentence; the caller decides whether it is a warning or a refusal, because the
 * two callers differ. The planner ASKED for the host and can be given the device instead, which
 * is always a correct answer; an explicit set_op_domain has no such fallback. */
