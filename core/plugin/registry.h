/* registry.h -- the plugin layer: dlopen, the configured hierarchy, the op-schema registry, the
 * constraint selector, bucket tables and the selection table. spec.md §2 and §16.
 *
 * Four rules live here and nowhere else, because every one of them is a rule somebody would
 * otherwise reinvent slightly differently in a second place:
 *
 *   THE HIERARCHY IS ABSOLUTE.  Plugins are queried in configured order and the first plugin with
 *   any matching kernel supplies it. A lower-priority plugin never outbids a higher one no matter
 *   how specialised its kernel -- that is what makes a user override an override (§2.1).
 *
 *   SPECIFICITY IS DECLARED, NOT DERIVED.  Within one plugin the highest `priority` among matching
 *   rows wins, ties broken by declaration order. Counting matched constraints gets it backwards:
 *   {head_dim<=1024, gqa>=1, block%16==0, causal in {0,1}} matches four and {head_dim==256, gqa==6}
 *   matches two, and the second is by far the more specialised.
 *
 *   SCHEMAS ARE FIXED BY FIRST DECLARATION.  The first plugin in hierarchy order to declare an op
 *   fixes its schema; a later plugin declaring the same op name with a different one is refused at
 *   load with both plugins named. Arguments are positional, so two disagreeing schemas make the
 *   same call mean different things depending on which plugin won selection -- silent numerical
 *   garbage rather than a diagnosable failure (§2.3).
 *
 *   THE BUCKET BOUNDARIES ARE THE CONSTRAINT VALUES THEMSELVES.  The union of the LE, GE and EQ
 *   values candidate kernels place on the ranged parameter, clamped to the declared range. No
 *   policy is chosen by anyone (§2.2).
 *
 *   A REFERENCE LIBRARY IS LAST BY CONSTRUCTION.  A library that declares itself one
 *   (RadPluginReferenceFn) matches every op it declares, so anything ranked behind it would be
 *   unreachable. An unnamed plugin sorts after every named one but still ahead of a reference,
 *   which is what makes dropping in a kernel library for a new card work with no configuration
 *   (§2.1). Naming it in the hierarchy still overrides that. The rule is keyed on the declaration,
 *   never on a name: the libraries that ship with radiance load exactly as a third party's do.
 *
 * LIFETIME. A Resolved, a Band and a KernelRow all point into a plugin's static tables. They are
 * valid exactly as long as the Registry that loaded them: close() dlcloses, and everything handed
 * out before it dangles after. The core keeps one Registry for the life of the process, so this
 * costs nothing; a tool that loads two kernel sets in turn has to finish with the first.
 *
 * THREADING. Loading is startup, single-threaded, before the rank threads exist. select() and
 * init_instance() are called from every rank thread during declare, so the selection log and the
 * instance list are behind one mutex. It is uncontended at declare and never touched on the step
 * path, which is the only place a lock would cost anything.
