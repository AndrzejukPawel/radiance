/* planner.cpp -- the placement planner. See planner.h for the design; this file is the mechanics.
 *
 * The planner runs once, between declare and load, and it is pure: it reads the Program, the
 * Config and the container's profile, and it writes a Plan. It queries no device, reads no clock
 * and looks at no environment. That is not tidiness -- it is what makes Config::deterministic
 * implementable (spec §17) and what makes the resident set identical on every tensor-parallel
 * rank (planner.h, MoveUnit).
 *
 * DO NOT ADD A DEVICE QUERY HERE, and the reason is concrete rather than principled. Every pool is
 * budgeted explicitly from Config (spec §6) -- no profiling pass, no utilisation fraction. A
 * planner that instead derived a budget from RadDeviceProps would have to cope with rad_dev_count()
 * reporting devices that are not the target: an integrated GPU enumerates alongside the discrete
 * ones and reports tens of GiB of "VRAM" that is really system RAM, so summing capacity across
 * devices overstates the budget by that much and produces a plan that cannot load. Any future code
 * that does look at props must be per-device and must filter on RadDeviceProps::arch, never on
 * index and never on capacity.

         * engine cannot repair that quickly: a promotion needs the candidate to beat the victim by
         * `hysteresis * cold + min_gain`, and an expert in a starved layer is routed to rarely
         * enough that the skew is worked off a few hundred units at a time, paying both link
         * directions for every one.
         *
         * WHAT THE SKEW COSTS IS ON-DEMAND STREAMING, not mover churn. A starved layer misses on
         * most of what it routes to and streams those shards over the link inside the GEMM, so its
         * expert projections run several times longer than a well-stocked layer's, every step.
         *
         * Expert-major puts expert 0 of every layer before expert 1 of any, so the budget cut
         * lands at the same expert index in every layer and residency starts balanced. That is
         * not a better RANKING -- with no profile there is no information to rank on -- it is the
         * absence of an arbitrary one, and it leaves the heat engine's moves to do the job it
         * exists for instead of repairing the fill. heat.h makes the same argument about its own
         * tie-break: ties go to the layer that can most afford it, never to the low index.
         *
         * NO CAPACITY IS ADDED BY THIS, and the per-layer residency histogram in HeatEngine::report
         * is where that shows: the mean resident count a layer is unchanged and only its spread
         * collapses. Well-stocked layers give up some slots and get slightly slower; starved ones
         * gain more than that back. The largest single beneficiary is whichever layer runs more
         * than once a step -- a draft head runs once per draft round -- because every slot there is
         * spent several times a step.
         *
         * Uniform is still the right fill when there is no profile to rank on, and the heat engine
         * already sees the extra activations of a multiply-run layer in its own counter, so the
