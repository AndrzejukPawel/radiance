/* planner.h -- the placement planner. Runs ONCE, after declare and before load, and assigns every
 * weight a tier and an execution site against explicit pool budgets (spec §5.3).
 *
 * ---- THE ONE IDEA IN THIS DIRECTORY ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * All-in-VRAM, layer offload to RAM/SSD, and expert offload to RAM/SSD are ONE MECHANISM AT THREE
 * GRANULARITIES. What separates them is not the tiering -- the tiers are the same four -- but
 * whether the access is PREDICTABLE, and that distinction is the shape of this code:
 *
 *   LAYER OFFLOAD IS A SCHEDULING PROBLEM. Declare already enumerated every op with its weight
 *   operands in order, so WeightInfo::first_use_op is the entire future access sequence, known
 *   statically. The planner emits an exact prefetch schedule off it (Plan::prefetch). No policy,
 *   no predictor, nothing to be wrong about.
 *
 *   EXPERT OFFLOAD IS A PREDICTION PROBLEM. Routing is data-dependent, so the only thing the
 *   planner can do is rank an initial residency and hand the rest to heat.h. This is why expert
 *   offload needs a heat engine and layer offload (llama.cpp's) does not.
 *
 *   ALL-IN-VRAM IS THE DEGENERATE CASE where every weight lands on tier 0 and the mover never
 *   runs. It is not a separate path; it is this one with a budget that fits.
 *
 * ---- TIER AND SITE ARE INDEPENDENT AXES (spec §5.1) --------------------------------------------
 *
 * Tier is where the bytes live. Site is where the arithmetic happens. All four combinations are
 * core behaviour:
 *
 *   VRAM       + Device          vLLM
 *   host/SSD   + DeviceStaged    staged into a slab slot, exact or predicted
 *   host       + DeviceZeroCopy  the GEMM streams the weight over the link as it computes; no
 *                                slab slot, so a read-once weight costs no residency at all
 *   host       + Host            llama.cpp -ngl
 *
 * Host-site execution needs a RAD_DOMAIN_HOST kernel. Where declare resolved none, that site is
 * UNAVAILABLE for that op, and the planner is told so by reading Band::dom[RAD_DOMAIN_HOST]
 * rather than by being passed a flag -- the resolution is the fact.
