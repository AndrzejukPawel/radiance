/* mover.h -- residency and the mover: the substrate every tier stands on.
 *
 * Three storage tiers, one address space of slots:
 *
 *   FIXED-STRIDE VRAM SLAB SLOTS PER WEIGHT CLASS. A slot is interchangeable within its class, so
 *   a promotion is an integer swap and not an allocation, and a slab that never fragments is a
 *   slab whose hit rate does not depend on the order promotions happened to arrive in.
 *
 *   A PINNED HOST POOL, at the same stride. Pinned rather than pageable because the whole point of
 *   the host tier is that a card can DMA out of it: a device-visible pinned pool is what makes a
 *   non-resident expert a zero-copy read inside the GEMM instead of a bounce-buffer memcpy in
 *   front of it. It is also allocated and owned here rather than read through the container's
 *   mmap, because with an mmap the KERNEL decides what stays resident and under real memory
 *   pressure it decides badly for this workload -- the same reads run several times slower inside
 *   a decode run than in isolation, and MADV_WILLNEED makes it worse, which is the tell that the
 *   faults are not too small and that a hint cannot fix a policy disagreement.
 *
 *   A FILE TIER READ WITH O_DIRECT INTO PINNED BUFFERS. Predictable latency, no page-cache
 *   double-copy, and the read lands where the mover can DMA from it without a bounce. A buffered
 *   fallback is refused rather than offered: a tier whose latency is the page cache's mood is not
 *   a tier you can budget against.
 *
 * ---- THE ONE PROPERTY EVERYTHING ELSE RESTS ON -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * THE MOVER RUNS ON A DEDICATED STREAM AND THE COMPUTE STREAM WAITS ON ITS EVENTS. NO HOST
 * SYNCHRONISATION IS INVOLVED IN A TRANSFER. That is what lets placement be dynamic without
 * serialising the step, and it is the difference between MoE offload being unusable and being
 * fast. rad_issue waits with rad_event_wait, never rad_event_sync.
 *
 * The lead gate below IS a host wait, and it is not a contradiction: it throttles how far the
 * host runs ahead of the cards. It is a SUPPLY mechanism, not a transfer synchronisation, and the
 * reason it exists is spelled out at MoverConfig::max_lead_dispatches.
 *
 * ---- SHADOW SLOTS AND QUARANTINE -------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A promotion writes into a SHADOW slot -- a slab slot that is allocated but holds nothing -- and
 * only then publishes the new pointer. So a live slot is never DMA'd over while a kernel might
 * still be reading it, and a promotion never invalidates a pointer the run phase is already
 * holding. Getting that ordering wrong does not crash: it produces fluent output with a different
 * hash every run, which is the single most expensive bug class in this design.
 *
 * The freed slot then goes into QUARANTINE rather than straight back to the free list, because
 * kernels issued in earlier layers still name its old address. The barrier is an event recorded
 * on the COMPUTE stream after the publish; when it signals, every launch that could still name
 * the slot has retired.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ slot bookkeeping */
/* Pure host state, no device call in it, so the whole supply half is testable without a card.
 * Used for both the VRAM slab and the pinned host pool -- they are the same structure with
 * different backing memory, and writing it twice is how two free lists come to disagree about
 * what a slot index means.
 *
 * ---- SEGMENTS: ONE RANGE FOR THE SLAB'S OWN SLOTS, ONE FOR EACH LENDER ------------------------
 *
 * The slots are numbered in SEGMENTS laid end to end. Segment 0 is the budgeted range the pool
 * was built with; every later one is a stretch of another pool's memory lent to this one -- the
 * KV cache's blocks, the activation arena's top -- added once its addresses are known. Each
 * segment has its own TARGET: the slots below it are the ones that may be handed out, and a
 * lender moves only its own. Two lenders cannot share one target, because what one of them can
 * spare says nothing about the other: the arena takes its memory back for every prefill while the
 * cache is still lending, and a single mark over both would either hold the arena's slots past its
 * recall or give up the cache's with it.
 *
 * ---- WHY THE LOWEST FREE SLOT, AND WHY A LIVE MARK -------------------------------------------
 *
 * A lent segment is VRAM its owner can want back, and it has to be handed back when it does. That
 * is only possible if the occupied slots pack toward the BOTTOM of the segment, so its top is free
 * to retire. Handing out the lowest free slot is what packs them; a LIFO stack hands back the slot
 * released most recently, which after a busy period is exactly the high slot the pool wants to
 * give up, and the mark would never fall.
 *
 * A segment's `live` is how far its slots exist right now and `target` how far they should. They
 * differ while a shrink waits on the units still sitting above the target: the mark stops at the
 * highest slot something holds, so shrinking can never evict -- it only declines to hand a slot
 * out again.
 *
 * THE FREE LIST IS REBUILT WHENEVER A TARGET MOVES, from the held flags, and holds exactly the
 * covered slots nothing holds. Carried across a shrink and a regrow instead, it lists only some of
 * the slots the shrink dropped -- a slot freed while it sat above the target is never pushed, and
 * one the heap still held is discarded by the first take() that walks past it -- and a regrow
 * that trusts it never hands the others out again. The rebuild is a scan of the capacity at the
 * arbiter's cadence; take() and add_free, which the mover calls several times a dispatch, stay
 * heap operations.

     * has grown by the shadow count and never shrinks again. The symptom is zero demotions
     * forever, and it appears only on a real card: on the host backend every copy lands inside
     * the dispatch that issued it, so the same mistake passes unnoticed.
     *
     * The compute stream must also carry the dispatch's actual work. The quarantine barrier is an
     * event on that stream and its claim is "every kernel that could still name this slot has
     * retired"; against an empty stream the claim is vacuous and the lead gate paces nothing.
