/* stager.h -- the prefill stager: a routed layer's non-resident experts copied onto the card one
 * layer ahead of the layer that reads them.
 *
 * ---- WHY A PREFILL NEEDS IT -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * An expert the slab has no room for lives in the pinned host pool, and a GEMM that routes to it
 * reads it across the link in place (Site::DeviceZeroCopy). At decode that is the right trade: a
 * step routes a few dozen rows to a few dozen experts and reads a few of them from the host. A
 * prefill chunk routes tens of thousands of rows to nearly EVERY expert of every layer, so the
 * whole pooled part of each layer -- ~85 MB a card on Qwen3.8-Flash-Next -- crosses the link inside
 * the layer's two GEMMs, at the link's rate and on the critical path, while the rest of the layer's
 * work leaves the link idle. Measured with r4d_selftest --perfmoe, the gate_up GEMM of a 2048-token
 * chunk is 1.53 ms with every expert on the card and 4.34 ms with the coldest 13% in host memory.
 *
 * So at a step large enough, the stager copies layer L+1's pooled experts into a VRAM buffer while
 * layer L runs, publishes the copies for layer L+1's ops, and publishes the host addresses again
 * once those ops are behind it. The copy is the same bytes the GEMM would have read, so the output
 * is bit-identical; only when the link carries them moves.
 *
 * ---- WHERE THE BUFFERS ARE, AND WHEN THEY ARE ITS ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * Two buffers, each one layer's share of the experts the budget leaves off the card, at the top of
 * the activation arena (Program::arena_stage_off, sized by vram_budget_resolve). A step smaller
 * than the arena's full plan LENDS that top to the expert slab, so the buffers are the stager's
 * only in a step at the full plan -- which is exactly the steps worth staging for -- and the rest of
 * the time they hold resident experts like any other lent slot. The scheduler says which it is,
 * pass by pass (set_full_arena).
 *
 * ---- THE ORDER, AND WHAT KEEPS IT SAFE ---------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   the pass's first op     stage the first routed layer the pass issues, into buffer 0 or 1
 *   a layer's first op      stage the NEXT layer into the other buffer; re-read the residency
 *                           table so this layer's ops resolve the copies made one layer ago
 *   a layer's last op       record "buffer free" on the op's stream; publish the host addresses
 *   the pass's end          the same for anything still staged: nothing outlives its pass
 *
 * A copy into a buffer waits on that buffer's "free" event, recorded behind the last op that read
 * the layer it held -- in this pass or an earlier one. The layer's ops wait on the copies' event
 * through ONE stream wait, issued before the layer's first op: the copies are published settled
 * (Mover::stage_units says why), and nothing but the layer's own ops ever resolves them.
 *
 * A LAYER IS STAGED AHEAD ONLY WHEN THE PASS WILL ISSUE IT. A step issues its routed layers across
 * more than one pass -- the trunk in one, the MTP head's in the next -- and the last layer a trunk
 * pass stages ahead would otherwise be the head's, copied for a pass that never reads it and thrown
 * away at its end. The stager learns the last op each kind of pass issues (by draft_pass) and stages
 * a layer ahead only when its first op is at or below it.

/* ---- THE FILE STAGER: routed layers read from the container -------------------------------------
 *
 * A routed unit the plan put on the file tier (--weights-disk-tier) has no address of its own, and
 * a grouped GEMM is handed every expert's pointer at issue. So on EVERY pass -- a decode step as
 * much as a prefill chunk -- each routed layer's file-tier units are read into one of the mover's
 * two file buffers before the layer's first expert op and published there, and published as null
 * again when the next routed layer starts. Which experts the router picks cannot be known on the
 * host without a round trip, so the whole layer's file-tier part is read; a prefill chunk routes to
 * nearly all of it anyway, and a decode step is paced by the drive -- the trade the flag names.
 *
 *   the pass's first op      read the first routed layer the pass issues
 *   a layer's first op       release the layer before (record its buffer free on the stream, publish
 *                            null), wait on this layer's copies, and read the NEXT layer into the
 *                            buffer just released -- its copies queue behind that free event
 *   the pass's end           release whatever is still held
 *
 * A LAYER IS RELEASED WHEN THE NEXT ONE STARTS, not at its own last op: a routed block that slices a
 * large step into passes of `rows` tokens issues its expert ops once a slice, so the last declared
 * op of the layer comes round again, and a release there would leave the second slice reading null.
 * Repeats of the current layer's first op do nothing.
 *
 * THE READ IS ON THE ISSUING THREAD and blocks it; the card meanwhile runs whatever was issued
 * before it. A routed layer's file-tier part is gigabytes and its compute milliseconds, so the step
 * is the drive's either way, and a reader thread would buy the few percent the layer's own compute
 * is worth at the cost of a second writer of the residency table.
 *
 * A layer is read ahead only when the pass will issue it -- the same learned bound PrefillStager
 * keeps (by draft_pass), so a trunk pass does not read the MTP head's layer for nothing. */
