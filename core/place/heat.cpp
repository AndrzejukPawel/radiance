 * activations rather than one -- the kind of off-by-a-constant that only ever shows up as a
 * threshold that does not do what it says.
 *
 * THE DECAY IS THE ONLY WORK EVERY POSITION NEEDS, so it is the only dense pass: one multiply a
 * float, vector code at any instruction set. A dispatch routes to a few dozen of a layer's
 * hundreds of experts, and everything else -- the credit, the pricing, the layer's ends -- is a
 * property of those, so it is done for those alone. `h * d` and then `+ c * w` round exactly as
 * the one expression `h * d + c * w` does, so the heats are the same bits either way.
 *
 * A ROUTED EXPERT IS PRICED HERE TOO. A unit not in VRAM is not a stall -- the GEMM reads it
 * where it lies -- but for every tier above VRAM that read crosses the link, and those are the
 * bytes the mover exists to stop paying. Pricing them on the pass that credits the heat puts the
 * hit rate and the streamed bytes beside the policy's decisions.
 *
 * THE LAYER'S ENDS FOLLOW FROM THE CREDITED EXPERTS WHEN THEY WERE VALID. A positive scale keeps
 * every order, and rounding is monotone, so the hottest unit off the device decays to exactly
 * `hot * d` and nothing uncredited passes it: the new hot end is that or a credited unit, whichever
 * is larger. The coldest units on the device decay to exactly `cold * d` likewise, and a credit
 * only raises a unit, so the cold end stands while any unit is left at it. The ends count the
 * units AT the cold value -- equal heats decay to equal heats -- because the common cold end is
 * a crowd: every resident unit no token has routed to yet sits at exactly zero. Only when the
 * last of them is credited is the next coldest unknown here, and the layer is rebuilt from its
 * positions. A tie decay creates is not counted, which can only rebuild a layer that did not need
