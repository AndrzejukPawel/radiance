/* heat.h -- the heat engine: which conditional weight should be in VRAM, decided from what the
 * router actually did.
 *
 * EXPERT OFFLOAD IS A PREDICTION PROBLEM. Layer offload is not -- declare enumerated the whole
 * access sequence and the planner emits an exact prefetch schedule off it. Routing is
 * data-dependent, so for RAD_ACCESS_CONDITIONAL weights there is no schedule to emit and the only
 * thing left is a policy. This file is that policy and nothing else: it sees a tier per unit, a
 * heat per unit and a dispatch count, and it answers one question -- "swap these two."
 *
 * Deliberately pure host code with no device call in it and no knowledge of slabs, streams or
 * events. Everything about how the bytes get there is mover.cpp. That split is what lets the
 * entire decision half be tested on a machine with no card, which is the only reason the
 * hysteresis behaviour below is checkable at all.
 *
 * ---- WHAT IT COSTS TO BE ONE STEP BEHIND, HONESTLY -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Routing is computed on device and never blocks the compute stream. The histogram is copied back
 * asynchronously and this engine consumes it on the NEXT step (spec §5.5), so every placement
 * decision is one step stale.
 *
 * For heat-based promotion that is irrelevant: a hot expert is hot across many steps, and a
 * ranking built from the step before ranks almost exactly the same as one built from this step.
 * The real cost is different and it is worth being blunt about, because it is what people expect
 * this file to do and it does not:
 *
 *   AN EXPERT THAT IS NOT RESIDENT THIS STEP CANNOT BE FETCHED IN TIME. It is served from
 *   wherever it is -- streamed out of the pinned pool over the link, or staged off the file tier.
 *   There is no last-moment rescue and there is no point adding one: the fetch would have to
 *   finish inside the gap between the router's output and the expert GEMM's first block, which
 *   is microseconds.
 *
 * Hit rate is therefore a property of the PLACEMENT POLICY, not of a rescue path. That is the
 * trade, and what it buys is a run phase with no device round-trip in it.
 *
 * ---- WHY LFU-WITH-DECAY AND NOT SOMETHING CLEVERER --------------------------------------------
 *
 * Replaying real routing traces against cache policies settles the shape of this. Runtime
 * placement beats static profile placement by a wide margin, so it is worth building; LFU-with-
 * decay and LRU score the same, so the decay constant is not where the wins are and this does not
 * need to be subtle. Belady is a few points of hit rate above both -- but an oracle restricted to
 * a disjoint sample of the future keeps most of that gap, so the remainder is knowledge of the
 * realised future and is not reachable. Of what is left, no statistic of PAST USE captures any of
 * it: an expert never selected has count zero, no age and no history, and most of the space is in
 * that state. The router's own gate value does separate those cases, so a scorer built on it is
 * the one direction here that measurement has not refuted.
