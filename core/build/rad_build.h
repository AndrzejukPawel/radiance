/* rad_build.h -- the declare phase (spec §3.1). The architecture plugin states everything it will
 * ever do; this is what receives it.
 *
 * Two properties are the whole point of the phase and everything here is arranged around them:
 *
 *   DECLARE ALWAYS COMPLETES. A missing kernel does not stop the walk. Every op, every band and
 *   every domain that resolved to nothing is accumulated with the constraint that refused it, and
 *   the full list is reported at the end. The first failure at the top tells you one thing; the
 *   whole list tells you whether you are missing a plugin or missing a model.
 *
 *   NOTHING IS DECIDED TWICE. Between declare and plan the model is known statically -- every op,
 *   every kernel that will service it, every weight it touches, and the order. The bucket table,
 *   the weight manifest, the buffer plan and the KV block sizes are all built once, here, so the
 *   step path indexes tables instead of asking questions.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COMPONENT DOES NOT DO. The kernel hierarchy, the op schemas, the constraint match and
 * the bucket boundaries are core/plugin/'s, and the Builder asks rather than reimplements: it
 * calls Registry::validate for the schema check and Registry::build_bands for the bucket table.
 * Two answers to one question is how a selector and a builder drift apart.
 *
 * LIFETIME. Every KernelRow, Resolved and RadOpSchema in the Program points into a plugin's static
 * tables, which the Registry dlclose()s. The Program must not outlive the Registry it was built
 * against, and neither may.
