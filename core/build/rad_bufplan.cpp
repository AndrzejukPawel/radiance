/* rad_bufplan.cpp -- the buffer plan (spec §3.1).
 *
 * Activations are declared, liveness is computed over the declared op list, and non-overlapping
 * lifetimes are packed into one arena sized once. The alternative is an allocator on the hot
 * path, and an allocator on the hot path is the thing this engine exists to remove.
 *
 * Two conservatisms are deliberate and both are stated in the spec: the arena is sized for
 * max_tok, and liveness is computed over the declared list, which is a superset of what any given
 * step issues. A plan that is correct for the worst step is correct for every step.
 *
 * The packer is greedy interval colouring, largest first: for each buffer in descending size
 * order, take the lowest aligned offset that collides with no already-placed buffer whose
 * lifetime overlaps. It is O(n^2) in the buffer count at declare, which for a few hundred
 * activations is microseconds, and it is within a few percent of optimal on the shapes that
 * matter -- the one big activation is placed first and everything else fills in around it.
 * Optimal packing here is NP-hard and the difference is not worth a solver.
