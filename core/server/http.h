/* core/server/http.h -- the transport seam.
 *
 * Everything above this line (routing, OpenAI translation, metrics) is written against these
 * plain structs and never sees a socket. That is what lets tests/server_test.cpp drive the real
 * handlers in-process: `Router::dispatch` is the same call the transport makes, minus the port.
 * The alternative -- testing by binding a loopback socket -- tests cpp-httplib, which is already
 * tested, and makes the suite depend on a free port.
