/* core/server/liveview.h -- the live view (spec §16).
 *
 * Per-card utilisation and VRAM, throughput, draft acceptance, and the expert plane coloured by
 * tier. It is a terminal view and nothing else: no web page, no port, no JSON.
 *
 * The rule that shapes the implementation is the last sentence of §16 -- piped or redirected it
 * prints ordinary lines instead. So there are two renderers, chosen once by isatty(), and the
 * non-interactive one emits no escape sequence at all. A log file full of cursor-home sequences
 * is a log file you cannot grep, and the failure is silent: it looks fine on the terminal where
 * it was written.
 *
 * The view owns no data. A snapshot function supplied by the engine fills a LiveSnapshot; this
 * component only draws it, which keeps the server free of any device dependency.
