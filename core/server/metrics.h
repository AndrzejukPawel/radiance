/* core/server/metrics.h -- Prometheus /metrics, with vLLM's metric names.
 *
 * The names are not ours to choose. There is a published Grafana dashboard for vLLM and a great
 * deal of alerting built on `vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket` and friends, and the point
 * of matching them is that swapping vLLM for radiance behind an existing deployment changes
 * nothing on the observability side. So: the vLLM names, the vLLM bucket boundaries, and the
 * vLLM label set (`model_name`, `engine`), copied exactly. Where vLLM renamed something we emit
 * both spellings -- `vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc` is what every dashboard in the wild queries and
 * `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc` is what current vLLM emits, and two gauges cost nothing.
 *
 * Anything vLLM does not have goes under `radiance:`. Inventing a new `vllm:` name would be worse
 * than useless: it would look to a dashboard like a metric it knows and is not.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT emitted is as important. `vllm:iteration_tokens_total` and
 * `vllm:request_queue_time_seconds` are properties of the scheduler's step loop, not of the HTTP
 * boundary, and the server cannot observe them. Emitting a plausible-looking approximation of a
 * latency breakdown is how a dashboard ends up lying, so they are absent until the scheduler
 * reports them, and their absence is documented rather than papered over.
