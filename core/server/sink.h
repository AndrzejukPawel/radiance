/* core/server/sink.h -- the per-request channel from the scheduler thread to the HTTP thread.
 *
 * `Request::sink` is the void* hook for this (rad_core.h). Exactly one scheduler thread writes it
 * and exactly one HTTP thread reads it, so it is a single-producer single-consumer ring and needs
 * no lock on the data path: a relaxed load of the head, a store into a slot, a release store of
 * the head. The producer never allocates and never blocks, which is the requirement -- a step
 * that can be delayed by a slow HTTP client is a step that has coupled every request in the batch
 * to the worst one.
 *
 * The wake-up is the one place a mutex appears, and only on the consumer's side of it. The
 * producer calls notify_one() without holding the lock, which can lose a wake-up in the window
 * between the consumer testing the predicate and sleeping; the consumer therefore waits with a
 * bounded timeout (RAD_SINK_POLL_MS) rather than indefinitely. The cost is named: a lost wake-up
 * adds at most that many milliseconds to one token's latency. The benefit is that the scheduler
 * thread never takes a lock an HTTP thread might be holding, and the same timeout doubles as the
 * interval at which the streaming path polls whether the client is still there.
 *
 * Tokens, not text: detokenisation is stateful and per-request (spec §12) and belongs on the HTTP
 * thread. Pushing an int32 keeps the producer's write to eight bytes and no allocation.
