/* core/server/server.h -- the OpenAI-compatible server (spec §14).
 *
 * Threading, in the spec's terms (§1): HTTP threads feed a request queue, one scheduler thread
 * produces one step. This object owns the HTTP thread pool and the admission queue; it does not
 * own the step loop and never calls into it. Output comes back per request through a Sink the
 * scheduler pushes into (sink.h), which `Request::sink` points at.
 *
 * Backpressure is admission control, not buffering. A full queue is a 429 with Retry-After. The
 * alternative -- accepting everything and letting the waiting list grow -- turns a load spike
 * into an out-of-memory kill twenty minutes later, at which point every in-flight request dies
 * rather than the marginal ones being refused up front.
 *
 * Cancellation is not an edge case. An agent client that abandons a long generation is the normal
 * case, so a dropped connection is detected on the streaming path (a failed write, or a closed
 * socket seen while waiting) and turned into IScheduler::cancel, which frees the request's KV
 * blocks immediately rather than at completion.
