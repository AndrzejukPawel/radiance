/* core/server/dashboard.cpp -- the web view of a running engine.
 *
 * Two routes: `/` serves a page, `/stats` serves the JSON it polls. Nothing else, and no
 * framework: the page is a string literal in this file, so there is no asset directory to install,
 * no build step that can go stale against the binary, and no network fetch at all. This engine is
 * deployed on machines with no route to a CDN, and a dashboard that renders blank without one is
 * a dashboard that does not exist.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST /metrics. Prometheus exposition is the right answer for an operator who has
 * a Prometheus, and this server serves it. It is the wrong answer for the question
 * being asked here -- "what is this process doing right now" -- because getting to that answer
 * costs a scrape config, a time-series database and a Grafana dashboard somebody has to build.
 * The engine already has a terminal view for exactly this (liveview.h, spec §16); this is the
 * same snapshot in a browser, which is where it can be looked at from another machine.
 *
 * THE PER-POSITION DRAFT PANEL IS THE POINT. Everything else here is visible in some other tool.
 * The conditional acceptance at each draft position is not: it is in SchedMetrics and in /metrics
 * as a labelled gauge, and no ordinary reading of either shows that one late position collapsed
 * while the pooled rate stayed plausible. As a bar chart it is the first thing seen.

 * public API: /metrics is that, with vLLM's names, and this is free to say whatever the page
 * needs. A client automating against radiance should scrape /metrics.
 *
 * DERIVED RATES ARE THE PAGE'S JOB, not this handler's. Tokens a second and milliseconds a step

/* ------------------------------------------------ THE FIRST ROW IS FIXED, THE REST FIT THEIR CONTENT
   A card whose content changes LENGTH moves every card under it while it is being read, and one
   card here does that every poll: the list of requests gains and loses rows. So the first row --
   the requests and the batch beside them -- is a definite height, the same in both columns, and
   its bodies scroll.
   Every other card holds a shape that is fixed for the life of the deployment: a card count, a
   draft depth, a tier ladder, a plane of layers by experts. Each line in them is clipped to one
   line or reserved at its full height whether or not it has text, so a card sized by its content
   cannot move -- and a definite height on one of them is either empty space under the figures or
   a scrollbar over figures that belong on screen. Below the first row the two columns therefore
   divide at different lines; they are separate questions and are not read across.
   The scrollbar gutter is reserved whether or not a body scrolls, for the same reason the
   document's is -- a bar that comes and goes is eight pixels of sideways movement -- and so the
   figures in every card of one column end at one x.
   min-width:0 is the other half of it -- see --side. Without it a panel whose widest row does not
   fit stretches the column instead of scrolling, and both columns move. */

 *
 * EVERY FIGURE ON THE PAGE GOES THROUGH THIS BLOCK, so two figures in one panel cannot disagree
 * about how many digits they are entitled to or which unit they are in. The rules:
 *
 * THREE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES, AT MOST TWO DECIMALS, ROUNDED BEFORE THE UNIT IS CHOSEN. Choosing
 * the unit first prints 1023.7 MiB as "1024 MiB" and 999.96k as "1000.0k": a figure one digit
 * wider than its column, in a unit the next one up exists to replace. Three figures is also what
 * keeps a four-digit throughput beside a two-digit one readable at a glance.
 *
 * SIZES IN BINARY UNITS -- B, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB -- because the card's memory, the cache carve and
 * every --*-mib flag count in them. RATES OF BYTES IN DECIMAL SI -- B/s, kB/s, MB/s, GB/s --
 * because link and disk bandwidth are specified that way, and a rate is read against a ceiling
 * quoted in those units.
 *
 * COUNTS TAKE SI PREFIXES -- k, M, G, T -- where a count is glanced at. Where one is READ (a
 * cumulative counter, a row of a table) it is exact and grouped in threes by a narrow space, as
 * SI writes it: a locale's separator is a comma in one browser and a full stop in another, and a
 * full stop beside this page's decimal points makes "1.234" mean two different numbers. Four
 * digits are left ungrouped, also as SI writes them.
 *
 * A SHARE NEVER ROUNDS ONTO 0% OR 100%. A pool at 99.96% is not full and a layer at 0.04% is not
 * empty, and those are exactly the two readings rounding would put on the screen. */
