/* core/server/oai.h -- the OpenAI schema, in and out.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * Errors are values. Nothing in this file throws; every entry point returns RAD_OK or a negative
 * status and fills an ApiError that already knows its HTTP status, its `param`, and a message
 * that names what was wrong. The HTTP layer turns that into a status code and a body. An
 * exception crossing the transport is a connection closed with no body, which is the least
 * diagnosable thing a client can be handed.
 *
 * A parameter we do not support is a 400 that names it. Not a silent ignore. A client that sends
 * `logit_bias` and gets a 200 has been told its bias was applied, and the resulting bug report
 * ("the model ignores my bias") is unanswerable from the server side. The cost of strictness is
 * that a client sending a field we have not heard of gets a 400 rather than a shrug; the
 * allowlist below is where the genuinely inert OpenAI metadata fields (`user`, `store`, ...)
 * are named, so that cost falls only on fields that actually mean something.
