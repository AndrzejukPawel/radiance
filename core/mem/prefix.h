/* prefix.h -- prefix caching (spec §7.3). TWO mechanisms, because full attention and linear
 * attention cannot share one.
 *
 * FULL ATTENTION: content-hashed blocks with a CHAINED hash, so a block's identity includes its
 * whole prefix. LRU eviction, copy-on-write on fork, and multimodal inputs hashed BY CONTENT --
 * an image is a cache hit, because the hash is taken over the EMBEDDING span rather than the
 * image bytes.
 *
 * LINEAR ATTENTION: a state checkpoint. A GDN layer's recurrent state at position N depends on
 * all of 0..N and is one fixed-size object per sequence -- 32 heads of 128x128 fp32 is 2 MiB a
 * layer, roughly 96 MiB across the 48 linear layers of a Qwen3-Next. Snapshotting that per 16-token
 * block is not affordable at any block count. We take vLLM's `--mamba-cache-mode align` mechanism
 * and change two things:
 *
 *   (a) THE CHECKPOINT INTERVAL IS DECOUPLED FROM THE ATTENTION BLOCK SIZE. vLLM inflates the
 *       attention block to match the mamba page -- 528 tokens for Qwen3.5, 2240 for the 35B-A3B --
 *       and since prefix caching is block-granular, every prompt shorter than that gets a 0% hit
 *       rate on ATTENTION as well. We could not inflate the attention block even if we wanted to:
 *       §7.2 takes it from the resolved kernel and libr4d's paged attention is compiled for 16.
 *       So attention caches at 16-token granularity and Config::checkpoint_interval is a separate,
 *       much larger number. A hit landing BETWEEN checkpoints reuses the attention blocks and
 *       replays only the linear layers forward from the last checkpoint. That is what CacheHit's
 *       two token counts are: `n_attn_tokens` is free, `[n_linear_tokens, n_attn_tokens)` costs a
 *       linear-layers-only forward pass, and the rest is an ordinary prefill.
 *
 *   (b) CHECKPOINTS ARE TAKEN DELIBERATELY, NOT OPPORTUNISTICALLY. vLLM writes one only when a
 *       scheduler step happens to end on a boundary, which is why a checkpoint landing in
 *       request-unique tokens silently drops caching to zero. Our scheduler owns chunk boundaries
 *       (spec §7.1) and splits a chunk AT the interval, so one is always written. The cost is an
 *       occasional short chunk; the benefit is that hit rate is a property of the workload rather
 *       than of scheduling luck. `next_checkpoint_after()` is what the scheduler splits on.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT COSTS TO HOLD, AND WHEN IT STOPS WORKING ==============
 *
 * The cache takes a KV REFERENCE on every block it indexes, so a finished sequence's blocks stay
 * held for the next turn. That is the whole point -- and it means the pool's demand is the number
 * of LIVE SESSIONS, not of running requests. Size it the other way and the failure is not graceful.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS POOL UTILISATION, and it is a CLIFF rather than a slope. Below roughly 75%
 * utilisation the cache is whole; by around 81% half of it is gone; once the sessions no longer
 * fit at all the cache is not degraded but DEFEATED -- each turn evicts the prefixes the next turn
 * wants, so every turn re-prefills its whole context and the hit rate is zero. The generated text
 * is unaffected either way; the only difference is whether the prefixes still exist when the next
 * turn asks for them, and that difference is one to two orders of magnitude of time to first
 * token. Size the cache so live sessions fit with room to spare -- a context of T tokens occupies
 * roughly 1.8 x T pool-tokens across the paged groups -- and keep --expert-vs-cache-ratio on the
 * safe side of that.
 *
 * WHAT TO WATCH: `kv_util` (/stats, or vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc) is the predictor, and
 * `radiance:prefix_cache_evictions_total` is the event -- the hit rate is neither, because it only
 * falls once a prefix that would have been reused is already gone.
