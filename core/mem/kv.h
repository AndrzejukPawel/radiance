/* kv.h -- the KV block manager (spec §7.2).
 *
 * Paged, per KV group, each group with its OWN block geometry, its own pool and its own slot
 * mapping. Block size comes from KVGroupInfo::block_size, which the build component took off the
 * resolved attention kernel's constraints -- never a core constant. A core that picked its own
 * block size would be a core that has to be edited when a kernel changes.
 *
 * Hybrid models are the normal case, not an extension. Four state kinds:
 *
 *   RAD_KV_FULL    paged, per-token, growing
 *   RAD_KV_WINDOW  paged, per-token, bounded by the window -- blocks below the window are recycled
 *   RAD_KV_LINEAR  per-sequence, FIXED size: the GDN recurrent state
 *   RAD_KV_CONV    per-sequence, FIXED size: a rolling window of conv_width-1 + n_spec entries
 *
 * The last two are not paged the same way, and they are allocated, mapped and freed BY THIS
 * MANAGER anyway, because otherwise two allocators disagree about what a sequence owns. That
 * disagreement is not a memory leak, it is a correctness bug: the scheduler frees a sequence and
 * one of the two allocators keeps handing its state slot to the next request.
