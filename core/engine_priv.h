/* engine_priv.h -- what the Engine's translation units share and nothing outside them sees.
 *
 * `Engine` is one class across four files because its phases have almost nothing to say to each
 * other: bring-up runs once and touches every subsystem; the step loop runs a thousand times a
 * second and touches four; the drafters are two shapes of extra pass; the probe is debug-only and
 * reads everything. Splitting them is not decomposition of the class -- the public surface in
 * engine.h is unchanged -- it is putting each phase where it can be read on its own.
 *
 * `Engine::Rank` lives here rather than in engine.h because it names every subsystem's concrete
 * type, and engine.h is included by main.cpp and the tools: a forward declaration there is what
 * keeps a caller that only wants to serve a model from compiling the pool allocator.
