/* tokenizer.h -- the tokeniser, driven by the step chain baked into the .rad.
 *
 * spec §12: "The tokenizer is the one place llama.cpp's answer is Python." Their vocab is
 * GGUF-shaped, the tokenizer.json -> vocab mapping lives in convert_hf_to_gguf.py, and at RUNTIME
 * they identify the pre-tokeniser by HASHING tokenizer.json against a hardcoded enum. An
 * unrecognised model therefore gets the default split, and the symptom of that is plausible text
 * with wrong token boundaries -- the hardest kind of wrong to notice, because nothing crashes and
 * the perplexity moves by a few percent.
 *
 * So the chain is DECLARED rather than recognised. rad-convert reads tokenizer.json's
 * normalizer / pre_tokenizer / decoder sections and emits them as RadVocabStep rows; this file
 * executes those rows in order. A model nobody has ever seen tokenises correctly if its
 * tokenizer.json is honest, and a model whose chain we cannot express fails at CONVERT time with
 * the step named, which is a diagnosis rather than a silent 2% regression.
 *
 * A `Split` step is a regex, and it is COMPILED at load (tokenizer_regex.h) into a DFA that
 * reproduces what HuggingFace tokenizers' Oniguruma reports for it, over Oniguruma's own Unicode
 * tables. A pattern outside the dialect that compiler implements does not load: the refusal names
 * the construct, and there is no second matcher behind it.
 *
 * What is lifted from llama.cpp (06938ac12, MIT -- see vendor/UPSTREAM):
 *   - the byte-level alphabet and the unicode category tables the non-regex steps read
 *                                                                        (vendor/llama/src/unicode*)
 *   - the shape of the BPE bigram queue and the UGM Viterbi              (src/llama-vocab.cpp)
 * The last of those is re-expressed here rather than vendored: llama-vocab.cpp is welded to
 * llama_model_loader, GGML_ASSERT and the llama_vocab class, so it is a file we would have had
 * to modify heavily, and spec §12 says such a file belongs in core/ under our own name.
