/* chat.h -- rendering a message list to a prompt, and what the template can do.
 *
 * This is a thin face over the lifted `common_chat_*` API (vendor/llama/common/chat.*, jinja/,
 * see vendor/UPSTREAM). It does three things the lift does not:
 *
 *   1. ERRORS ARE VALUES. Upstream throws -- a bad template, a message the template rejects, a
 *      malformed OAI request are all std::runtime_error, and a throw crossing the server's
 *      request loop is not a failure mode this project accepts. Everything here returns a
 *      negative RAD_E_* and logs once.
 *   2. It takes the template out of the .rad instead of out of a llama_model. RadVocabHeader
 *      carries the chat template, the BOS/EOS spellings and the add_bos/add_eos flags, which is
 *      exactly the four things common_chat_templates_init() would otherwise read off a model.
 *   3. It keeps the lifted headers out of the rest of core/. Only chat.cpp, chatfmt.cpp and
 *      chatparse.cpp include them, the last only to resolve schema types when a request's tools
 *      are bound, so a vendor refresh cannot ripple into the server.
 *
 * Messages and tools arrive as OpenAI-shaped JSON, because that is what the server has and the
 * lift already knows how to read it. Converting to a struct here and back inside would be a
 * translation nobody asked for.
