/* device.h -- the device layer's internal face.
 *
 * `abi/rad_device.h` is what the rest of the engine and every plugin calls. This header is
 * the seam between the two implementations of it, plus the two questions the rest of the core
 * actually needs to ask about which one won.
 *
 * The seam is a vtable rather than an `#ifdef` at every call site. That is a deliberate trade: an
 * indirect call costs a load and a jump, which is unmeasurable against a `hipMemcpyAsync` and
 * unmeasurable against a `memcpy` of anything worth enqueuing, and in exchange there is exactly one
 * definition of each `rad_dev_*` symbol and no way for the two backends to drift into implementing
 * different contracts. Two device layers that have silently diverged is the failure this avoids,
 * and it is the failure that matters, because the host backend is where everything above the
 * kernels is developed (docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) and the HIP backend is where it has to still work.

 * rediscovered:
 *
 *  1. `rad_memset_async` requires a DEVICE-ACCESSIBLE destination: RAD_MEM_DEVICE,
 *     RAD_MEM_HOST_PINNED or RAD_MEM_HOST_MAPPED. Plain RAD_MEM_HOST is pageable memory the GPU
 *     has never been shown and hipMemsetAsync refuses it. The host backend cannot reproduce that
 *     refusal, so this is the one asymmetry between the two -- see the comment on d_memset_async
 *     in hip.cpp for why it is reported rather than papered over. `rad_memcpy_async` has no such
 *     restriction: hipMemcpyDefault handles pageable memory on both ends.
 *
 *  2. A null RadStream is refused by BOTH backends. HIP's stream 0 serialises against every other
 *     blocking stream in the process, which is the opposite of spec §5.4's requirement that a
 *     transfer involve no host synchronisation; the engine creates its streams and never uses the
 *     default one, so passing null is a bug and the host backend reports it as one as well.

    /* ---- elastic memory: an address range whose SIZE IS FIXED AND WHOSE BACKING IS NOT.
     *
     * A pool allocated whole owns its bytes for the life of the process, which is the right trade
     * for a pool whose demand is known at startup and the wrong one for two pools that take
     * turns. The KV cache and the expert slab are that pair: the cache holds what the live
     * sessions hold and nothing more, and a byte it is not holding is a byte the expert plane
     * would rather have resident than stream over the link.
     *
     * WHY THIS IS A PRIMITIVE AND NOT FREE-THEN-REALLOCATE. The KV pool is layer-major
     * (core/mem/kv.h): layer i lives at `base + i * n_blocks * layer_bytes_per_block`, so the
     * block count is baked into every layer's base address and the unused blocks are a stripe
     * inside each layer rather than a tail anyone could hand back. Reserving the address range at
     * its maximum and backing only part of it leaves every stride where the kernels already
     * expect it while the physical pages come and go underneath.
     *
     * A backend without elastic memory leaves these null, and everything above it sizes its pools
     * once and lives with the split: the absence is a configuration rather than a degradation.
     *
     * The contract:
     *
     *   `vmem_reserve` takes address space and no pages.
     *
     *   `vmem_commit` backs ONE GRANULE and `vmem_decommit` unbacks one. A MAPPING IS UNMAPPED
     *   EXACTLY AS IT WAS MAPPED: a driver handed four granules in one call refuses to unmap the
     *   second of them on its own. VMem below therefore issues one call per granule and never a
     *   run, which is what makes the granule the unit a pool can grow and shrink by.
     *
     *   `vmem_protect` grants this device read/write access to a range that is already backed. It
     *   is separate from the commit because the range to name is not the one just mapped: access
     *   set over a granule adjacent to an already-accessible one is refused where the whole
     *   contiguous run containing both is accepted, so VMem names the run.
     *
     *   `vmem_release` takes a range with nothing committed in it.
