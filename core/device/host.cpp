/* host.cpp -- the host device backend.
 *
 * This is a primary development target, not a fallback. On a machine with no ROCm the builder, the
 * planner, the mover, the scheduler, the KV manager, the tokeniser, the sampler's host reference
 * chain and the server all run and are tested through these fourteen calls
 * (docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md). It is also the code path a RAD_DOMAIN_HOST kernel runs on when the
 * planner puts a layer on the CPU, which is the fourth row of spec §5.1's table.
 *
 * The one design decision worth defending: **the streams are real.** Each stream is an in-order
 * work queue with its own worker thread, and an event is a sequence number that a stream reaches.
 * A backend whose "async" calls execute inline would let ordering bugs -- a missing
 * rad_event_wait, a buffer reused before the mover's copy landed -- pass every test here and
 * corrupt weights on a real device. The cost is one thread per stream and one condition-variable
 * wake per enqueue, which is nothing against the value of exercising the contract the HIP backend
 * actually has.
 *
 * The second: **no allocation on the step path.** The mover enqueues a transfer per weight per
 * layer dispatch, so the queue is a fixed-capacity ring of POD tasks sized at stream creation, not
 * a deque of std::function. A std::function holding a destination, a source and a length does not
 * fit libstdc++'s small-object buffer and would call operator new inside rad_memcpy_async, which
 * is exactly the thing docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md forbids on the step path.
