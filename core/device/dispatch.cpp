 *
 * The VRAM budget (core/mem/vram_budget.cpp) spends the card down to --gpu-headroom-mib, which

 * allocation that eats the headroom and then fails somebody else's.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE, and it is stated here because the number is only honest with the caveat
 * attached: a kernel plugin that calls hipMalloc itself goes nowhere near this file. libr4d does,
 * for its split-tail workspaces and its all-reduce peer scratch, and the engine's own accounting
 * cannot include them. Engine::start reads the card back after everything has allocated for
 * exactly that reason -- the ledger says what the core spent, the card says what was spent.
