/* share.h -- which bytes of a container entry one rank's declaration takes.
 *
 * A container entry is a logical weight's planes, whole and canonical (rad_format.h). A rank
 * declares a VIEW of it (RadWeightDecl::source/planes) and, under tensor parallelism, only its
 * share: a ROW shard is rows of every selected plane and a COL shard is columns, each cut on the
 * plane's own block boundary and refused where a block would be split (spec §4.3). This is that
 * arithmetic, and nothing else -- the loader turns its rectangles into reads.
 *
 * Pure, so a test can hold it to the shapes tensor parallelism actually produces: a stacked
 * [gate|up] whose every part is split, an uneven span, a block-fp8 scale plane cut at 1/128 of
 * its weight's rows, a per-tensor scale every rank carries whole.
