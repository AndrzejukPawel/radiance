/* encoding.h -- the core's half of a weight encoding: decoding one to f32, and cutting a plane for
 * tensor parallelism. The encoding itself is abi/rad_encoding.h; spec.md §4.1.
 *
 * The core decodes the two schemes it defines, "plain" and "affine", under every transform the
 * ABI names, and nothing else: a quantiser that invents a scheme decodes it (abi/rad_quant.h). The
 * decoder is what the oracle checks a kernel through, what rad-convert measures a quantiser's
 * error with, and what a weight is read back through to be quantised again -- three consumers
 * that must agree on what a stored weight means, which is why there is one of it.
