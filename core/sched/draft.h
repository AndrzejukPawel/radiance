/* draft.h -- the speculative draft-depth controller.
 *
 * IT IS STATIC. The depth is `--num-speculative-tokens` and nothing moves it.
 *
 * No dynamic policy sits here, and the reason is structural rather than a tuning failure. The
 * dynamic policy this engine is otherwise modelled on -- a confidence-product gate against a
 * decayed per-position acceptance estimate, plus a batch-size ceiling schedule -- gates on the
 * DRAFTER's own top-1 confidences, per slot, on device, after the drafter has run. The scheduler
 * decides the depth BEFORE the drafter runs and cannot see them; the only substitute available
 * here is measured acceptance, which is the right quantity in expectation but arrives one step
 * late and pooled across sequences. Against a draft head whose cost is nearly flat in depth (one
 * extra verify row on a step that is weight-bound, not compute-bound) that estimate has nothing to
 * buy: the best depth is a property of the model pair, it is known before the serve starts, and it
 * is a flag. A controller that can only pick a worse depth than the constant contributes only the
 * risk that it picks one.
 *
 * What survives is the accounting, because the acceptance rate is a reported metric (spec §14)
 * and because a verify that accepts nothing has to be visible.
