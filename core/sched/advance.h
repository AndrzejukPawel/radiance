/* advance.h -- the card's own bookkeeping between passes: which drafts a verify step accepted, and
 * the inputs of every pass that follows from it.
 *
 * WHY THE CARD DOES THIS AND NOT THE HOST. A speculative step is a verify pass and the draft passes
 * behind it, and every pass after the verify depends on how many drafts it accepted: the draft
 * head continues from the accepted position, and the next verify starts after it. Deciding that on
 * the host means reading the sampled tokens back, waiting for them, and only then staging the next
 * pass -- a synchronisation per step during which the card has nothing queued. Deciding it here
 * lets the host stage and issue every pass of a step, and the next step, before any of them has
 * run: the rule is a compare of a few integers a sequence, and the card already holds all of them.
 *
 * THE STATE IS PER SEQUENCE SLOT (StepSlot), in device memory on every rank, and it carries exactly
 * what a pass needs that the host cannot know in advance: where the next verify starts, what it
 * rolls back, which tokens it verifies, and where the draft head continues from. Every rank keeps
 * its own copy and computes the same numbers from the same sampled tokens, so no rank ever reads
 * another's memory.
 *
 * A PASS NAMES ITS DEVICE ROWS. A batch can mix rows whose inputs the host staged -- a prefill
 * chunk, a history row for positions the host already knows -- with rows whose positions come from
 * the card; `rows[0][i]` says which, and the advance leaves a host row exactly as it was uploaded.
 *
 * The same code runs on the host backend, where device memory is host memory and a stream runs
 * its work as it is issued (advance_impl.h is shared by both builds).
