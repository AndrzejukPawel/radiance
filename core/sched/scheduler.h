/* scheduler.h -- continuous batching, chunked prefill, a priority queue, preemption by recompute.
 * ONE scheduler decision per step, producing ONE RadBatch (spec §7.1).
 *
 * Host time spent here is time the GPU spends idle, so this component is written to be cheap and
 * to build things once. Everything on the step path comes out of a pool sized at max_tok /
 * max_seqs; the only allocation the scheduler performs is on arrival and completion, which are
 * the HTTP thread's problem and not the step's.
 *
 * Two things it owns that vLLM's does not:
 *
 *   - CHUNK BOUNDARIES, and it uses that. A prefill chunk splits at a linear-state checkpoint
 *     interval, so a checkpoint is always WRITTEN rather than landing wherever a step happened to
 *     end. vLLM writes one only when a step's end coincides with a boundary, which is why a
 *     checkpoint landing in request-unique tokens silently drops linear caching to zero. The cost
 *     of doing it this way is an occasional short chunk; the benefit is that hit rate is a
 *     property of the workload rather than of scheduling luck (§7.3).
 *
 *   - DRAFT DEPTH, controlled against measured acceptance (draft.h, §10).

     *                  tokens: the anchor at the sequence's own next position and a mask at each
     *                  of the `block - 1` after it. `out_ids` names THE LAST `depth` ROWS, which
     *                  is the one rule both trained conventions reduce to: at block = depth + 1
     *                  the anchor row predicts nothing and each mask row predicts the token at
     *                  ITS OWN position, and at block = depth every row predicts the token AFTER
     *                  it and the anchor is not wasted. rad_builder.h argues the pair.
     *   block_end         moves the filled range over what actually ran.
     *
     * The proposal does not come back through the sampler: the drafter writes it to the buffer it
     * declared as its proposal, and the engine publishes it through set_draft() like any other.
