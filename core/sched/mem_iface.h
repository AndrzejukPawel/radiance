/* mem_iface.h -- the seam between core/sched and core/mem.
 *
 * core/mem owns the concrete `KVManager` and `PrefixCache`. The scheduler binds to the pure-virtual
 * mirrors below rather than to those classes directly, for two reasons and neither is abstraction
 * for its own sake:
 *
 *   - it lets tests/sched_test.cpp drive the scheduler against a block pool it can make
 *     arbitrarily small, which is the only way to test admission refusal and preemption at all;
 *   - it costs one indirect call per SEQUENCE per step (at most max_seqs, a few hundred), not one
 *     per token, so it is off the part of the step path that is actually hot.
 *
 * `KVBinding` / `PCBinding` at the bottom adapt the concrete classes and require no change on
 * their side. They are templates so that they are only type-checked where the engine instantiates
 * them -- so a method core/mem does not provide is a compile error at exactly one line rather
 * than a comment nobody reads.
 *
 * The interface below mirrors core/mem/kv.h and core/mem/prefix.h.
 *
 * `CacheHit` comes from core/mem/prefix.h and is NOT redefined here. Two identical definitions of
 * a struct that crosses a component boundary is an ODR violation that costs nothing today and
 * becomes a silent layout mismatch the first time one side adds a field.
