/* batch.h -- the step batch, built ONCE PER STEP BY THE CORE and shared by every layer and every
 * KV group (spec §8).
 *
 * vLLM builds this per KV-cache group, per layer, in Python, and that shape is what this file
 * exists to avoid: a model whose linear-attention layers fall into several KV-cache groups runs
 * the metadata builder once per group, and every run after the first produces values identical to
 * it -- dozens of tiny dispatches a step for numbers already computed, and host time on the step
 * path is time the GPU spends idle.
 *
 * So: one build, one owner, every consumer reads the same buffers.
 *
 * Everything here comes out of pools sized at max_tok / max_seqs at init. Nothing on this path
 * allocates. Staging is PINNED HOST memory crossing in one async copy a rank, out of a RING so
 * that a build is never written while an earlier build's copy is still reading it -- the cost of
 * getting that wrong is a torn block table, which shows up as a sequence reading another
 * sequence's KV and reads as a model quality problem -- and so that the host can stage several
 * passes ahead of the card without waiting for any of them.
