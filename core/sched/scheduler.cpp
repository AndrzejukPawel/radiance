 * are real forward passes through the draft head. Timed at commit they fall between that commit
 * and the next step(), a gap the engine loop charges to nothing at all: the reported step time
 * comes out short by the draft pass and `decode_tps` -- which divides by the same interval --
 * comes out correspondingly high, which is the direction of error nobody reports.
 *
 * So the engine says when the iteration is genuinely finished and the accounting happens here.
 * Separate from commit() rather than folded into it because they answer different questions:
 * commit() retires a step's tokens, and this closes the engine's loop around it. A caller that
 * only drives commit() -- the scheduler tests -- gets correct counters and no timing, which is
 * the honest answer for a step that never ran on a device.
 *
 * THE RATE IS TOKENS OVER WALL TIME ACROSS A WINDOW, NOT AN AVERAGE OF STEP RATES. A step's
 * interval is host time, and the host does not wait on the card at every step: a prefill chunk
 * that samples nothing is committed while the card is still on it, and a later step's wait pays
 * for it. Averaged as rates, those short intervals dominate -- a 2048-token chunk committed 70 ms
 * after it began reads 30K tok/s -- while the step that absorbed the wait counts once, and the
 * same skew reads decode high. Summed, all of the time is there: each kind's tokens and the wall
 * time since the last step ended -- which also covers a step issued ahead, whose start precedes
 * its predecessor's end, without counting that overlap twice -- or since this step began, when
 * the engine sat idle in between; all three decayed with one time constant.
 *
 * A STEP WITH NO TOKENS OF A KIND STILL ADDS ITS TIME. Skipping it instead would freeze the rate
 * at whatever it last was, so a server that prefilled once long ago would report that prefill
 * throughput for the rest of its life, and a busy engine can read as an idle one.
 *
 * Not a device measurement: enabling per-op timing restores synchronisations that change the
 * mover's slot supply, so a profiled run is not comparable anyway (spec §16). This is the number
 * an operator can always have. */
