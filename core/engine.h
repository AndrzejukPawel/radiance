/* engine.h -- the startup sequence and the step loop. This is the file that says, in order, what
 * happens between a command line and a served token, and it is deliberately the thinnest thing in
 * the project: every step below is one component doing its own job.
 *
 * Startup, per spec §1:
 *
 *   1. Load kernel plugins from $RADIANCE_HOME/kernels/, in the configured hierarchy order.
 *   2. Load the model's metadata ONLY -- architecture id, dimensions, quantisation, vocab.
 *   3. Look up the architecture id in $RADIANCE_HOME/architectures/. No match, no model.
 *   4. DECLARE. The architecture plugin enumerates every weight, buffer and op it will ever
 *      issue. The core resolves each op against the kernel hierarchy. This phase ALWAYS
 *      completes; if anything failed to resolve, the full list is reported at the end rather
 *      than the first failure at the top.
 *   5. PLAN. The placement planner assigns every weight a tier and an execution site, against
 *      explicit pool budgets.
 *   6. LOAD. Weights are mapped and staged according to the plan.
 *   7. Serve.
 *
 * Between 4 and 5 the whole model is known statically: every op, every kernel that will service
 * it, every weight it touches, and the order. That is the property the rest of the engine spends.
