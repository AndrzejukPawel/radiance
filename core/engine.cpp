/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ the tiering seam
 *
 * WHERE THE HEAT ENGINE RUNS, AND WHY IT IS A STEP AND NOT A LAYER. mover.h writes its run-phase
 * contract as "the order a layer dispatch calls it", and ctx.cpp states the invariant that
 * decides the unit: THE MOVER RELOCATES BETWEEN STEPS, NEVER DURING ONE -- `weights_dirty_` is
 * honoured once at the top of run_step, so a table edit made mid-step would be seen by some
 * issues and not others. A step is therefore the dispatch, and this pair brackets it.
 *
 * IT RUNS ONCE A STEP, AFTER THE STEP'S FORWARD PASS IS ON THE QUEUE:
 *
 *   - AFTER, because nothing in it is work the pass waits for. Ahead of a draft pass the device
 *     is idle -- the previous pass was drained to read its proposal -- so whatever the rank thread
 *     does before its first dispatch is time the device sits out; behind the issue it runs under
 *     the pass instead. Nothing it changes can reach the pass just issued: table edits are
 *     honoured at the top of the NEXT run_step, and a slot it frees is quarantined behind an event
 *     on the compute stream recorded after this pass.
 *   - ONCE A STEP, on the trunk pass and not the draft passes, because a swap almost never
 *     clears the hysteresis between two passes of one step and every call ranks the whole
 *     movable set. The draft head's histograms are not lost by it: they accumulate in the step's
 *     bank and are credited at the next step, weighted by the passes they stand for.
 *   - `begin_dispatch` only RETIRES. It never starts anything, so a loop that retires without
 *     issuing is not a slower engine but a stuck one (mover.h says so at length). The issue call
 *     below is the other half and they are written together for that reason.
 *   - The histograms this credits are the PREVIOUS step's -- a copy is asynchronous and lands
 *     while the step that produced it is still running (spec §5.5) -- and `histogram_ready` says
 *     which have landed.
 *
 * ON A LONG PREFILL CHUNK ALMOST NONE OF THIS LANDS, and the counters below say so rather than
 * leaving it to be inferred from a placement that will not settle. This runs BEFORE run_step and
 * every issue path is enqueue-and-return, so on a chunk worth most of a second of device time the
 * host is many steps ahead of the card: the freshest bank holds a copy the device has not reached,
 * `histogram_ready` is 0, and the layer is skipped. Through a prefill of 2048-token chunks about 2%
 * of the layer-histograms are credited and the rest skipped as not yet landed, against effectively
 * all of them at a decode shape, where the step is short enough that the device keeps up. The same
 * shortfall is what the link panel's expert-streaming share is computed from, so it reads near zero
 * through a prefill that is in fact streaming.
 *
 * `heat_seen` is what stops a layer being credited twice. A bank holds its counts until the next
 * report overwrites them, so a step in which some layer did not route -- a drafter pass, or a
 * bisect running fewer layers -- would otherwise credit the stale plane again and again.

             * true and the conclusion does not follow, because there is a third rule that needs
             * no planes at all:
             *
             *   accept draft[k] when it equals the token the target ITSELF drew at position k.
             *
             * That is exact because the sampler gives every verified position its own RNG
             * coordinate -- `p.pos = n_out + k`, "its randomness is the same whether it arrived
             * through speculation or one token at a time" (sampler.cpp). So y_k is the draw the
             * target's own distribution specifies at that output position. The first emitted token
             * is y_0 whether or not the draft agreed; every later one is conditioned on a prefix
             * that was accepted only because it matched, so the conditioning is the one the target
             * asked for. The emitted sequence is a draw from the target, not an approximation of
             * one.
             *
             * IT IS NOT, HOWEVER, BYTE-IDENTICAL TO A NON-SPECULATIVE RUN ABOVE TEMPERATURE 0, and
             * that is worth stating because the paragraph above sounds like it should be. The rule
             * is exact given the same logits; the logits themselves are shape-dependent, because a
             * verify step computes 1 + n_spec rows where a decode step computes one and split-K
             * picks its count from M. At temperature 0 that survives the argmax and the text
             * matches exactly. Above it a sampled pick near a CDF boundary can land the other way,
             * so spec and non-spec agree on most prompts and not all -- deterministic and
             * reproducible either way, and a property of the GEMMs rather than of acceptance.
             *
             * It accepts less often than optimal rejection sampling -- P(y == x) rather than
             * min(1, p/q) -- and that is the whole price. Refusing instead would cost the request
             * every drafted token AND take the step down with it, failing every other request
             * batched alongside, for the common case of a client that left temperature at 1.
             *
             * `so.rows` is the sampler's OUTPUT, which is the sampled token -- at temperature 0
