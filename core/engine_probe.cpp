 * of each: its mean, its largest magnitude and its first four elements. RADIANCE_DUMP_HEAD=<n>
 * adds the first n elements verbatim (integers included) and RADIANCE_DUMP_TOPK=<k> the k largest.
 *
 * It exists because nothing else can see INSIDE a step. rad-kbench falsifies one op against the
 * oracle and passes; --debug-graph shows what was declared and resolved; and between them sits a
 * forward pass that answers the same token to every prompt with every op individually correct.
 * The layer bisect narrows that to a block, and this narrows it to a tensor -- which is as far as
 * anything short of a second implementation can go.
 *
 * An environment variable and not a flag, and only at -vv, because it is a device-to-host copy and
 * a synchronisation per step: it changes what it measures, like every probe does. */

     * and every build under comparison sees IDENTICAL inputs at one row each. The top of that row,
     * over enough prompts, is a next-token distribution comparison -- top-1 agreement, rank
     * displacement, and the gap between the first and second logit, which is what decides whether a
     * perturbation can flip the token at all.
     *
     * WHY A GENERATED CONTINUATION IS NOT EVIDENCE. Divergence at temperature 0 is chaotic: two
     * numeric formats can agree for hundreds of tokens and then differ arbitrarily, so one
