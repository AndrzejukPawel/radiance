 *
 * A DEVICE miss whose op DID resolve on the host is not a hole at all. The planner puts that op's
 * arithmetic on the host and its weights in the container's mapping, which is the whole of how
 * `embed_lookup_q` serves a table too large to copy into VRAM. Reporting that as fatal produces
 * an error nobody believes, and an error nobody believes is how a real one goes unread.
 *
 * A HOST miss removes ONE placement option for ONE op, and for a kernel library written for a GPU
 * it is the ordinary case rather than news: most ops have no host implementation and never will.
 * One line for all of them.

 *
 * A WEIGHT THE LOADER HAS TO REARRANGE (spec §4.3): the resolved kernel stores something other
 * than the container's canonical planes -- a fragment order, a scale carried in each row's tail --
 * or the declaration widens a bf16 plane to f32. Its share of the planes is read out of the sweep
 * into host memory of its own, and when the last byte of it has arrived a worker produces the
 * stored form: straight into its host pool, or, for VRAM, into memory of its own and up through
 * that worker's pinned bounce buffers.
 *
 * IT HAS TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DISK, because Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 rearranges 24 GiB of its 29 at every
 * load and a single thread scattering bytes into fragment order runs at a fraction of 7 GB/s. So
 * it is a pool, and the sweep only reads: the copies out of its windows -- into a staged input,
 * or into a host pool slot -- are the pool's too, taken before any relayout, because a window
 * cannot be read into again until they are done. On the sweep thread those copies, and the first
 * touch of every fresh input, would run in series with the reads.
 *
 * AND IT HOLDS A BOUNDED AMOUNT, because a staged input is a copy of the weight in host memory and
 * a model is larger than that memory. A new input waits for room while there is finished work
 * that will free some -- and only then: a weight still arriving cannot be relaid, so waiting on
 * it would wait forever. Past the bound with nothing finished, the input is taken anyway. */

/* THE ONE PASS OVER THE CONTAINER, SERVING EVERY RANK.
 *
 * The runs arrive in declaration order, grouped by rank. Sorted by FILE OFFSET they become a
 * single front-to-back sweep: read a window, hand it to every rank that asked for a piece of it,
 * move on. That is three separate wins over reading per rank as the walk goes:
 *
 *   - the file is read ONCE. A weight every rank wants -- every replicated weight, which is
 *     gigabytes on a large container -- would otherwise be read once per rank.
 *   - the reads are SEQUENTIAL. A declaration-order access pattern reads at a fraction of an
 *     NVMe disk's sequential rate; one thread reading front to back reaches it, and more threads
 *     do not help -- provided the reads go around the page cache. A buffered pread is the kernel
 *     copying every byte out of the cache into the window on this one thread, and that copy,
 *     not the disk, sets the rate: about two thirds of it alone, and half once the relayout
 *     pool's copies share the memory system. O_DIRECT lands the disk's DMA in the window itself.
 *   - the copies OVERLAP the reads. A ring of pinned windows, an event a rank on each: the read
 *     that fills one window runs while the copies out of the others are in flight -- the DMAs to
 *     the cards, and the pool's memcpys to host memory. Serialising them costs about a fifth of
 *     the load rate; waiting on the stream instead of on the event costs the same, because the
 *     stream also holds the copies this read was supposed to hide under.
 *
 * Host pinned memory is portable across devices in one process, so ONE window feeds every card:
 * copying each window to all of them still runs at the disk's rate rather than the link's. */

         * carries one query length for every KV group, so the linear layers cannot be replayed
         * over a longer range than the attention layers, and the correct answer is to recompute
         * from the checkpoint (core/sched/scheduler.cpp, admit_one). A session whose blocks came
         * back and whose state did not therefore gets a hit of ZERO -- the blocks are not a
         * partial win, they are unusable -- and the snapshot store is not a nice-to-have beside
         * the block store, it is the thing that decides whether any of this works.
         *
         * So the split is DERIVED, from the session the operator sized the server for. At
         * --max-model-len M a session costs
         *
         *     blocks     (M / block_size) * slot_bytes

         * which is the only sense in which they can be balanced. The ratio is strongly length
         * dependent -- snapshots want 22% of the tier at 200K and more than half at 32K, because
         * the retained set grows logarithmically while the blocks grow linearly -- which is
         * exactly why a single fixed fraction is the wrong shape.
         *
         * Two thirds is the ceiling. Not because the arithmetic asks for one, but because the
