/* sampler.h -- the sampler driver.
 *
 * SAMPLING RUNS ON DEVICE (spec §13). At a 151K vocab and batch 256 the logits are ~77 MiB a
 * step; moving them across the link to run a host chain costs both the bandwidth and a
 * synchronisation, on the step path, at exactly the concurrency the engine exists to serve. So
 * every sampler is a kernel, not a lift -- and this file does not implement one. It ISSUES the
 * declared sampler ops in order, exactly as an architecture plugin issues a GEMM: declared
 * through the ordinary builder, resolved through the ordinary hierarchy, serviced by
 * `libref` on the host domain or by a device plugin on the fast one.
 *
 * THE ORDER, and it is not a detail -- reordering changes which tokens survive:
 *
 *     penalties (repetition / frequency / presence, then DRY)
 *     temperature
 *     the grammar mask
 *     top-k
 *     top-p, min-p, typical
 *     XTC
 *     the pick
 *
 * A GREEDY SEQUENCE SKIPS ALL OF IT and takes `sample_argmax` -- after penalties and the mask,
 * because temperature 0 collapses every other logit to -inf and a mask applied afterwards would
 * leave nothing at all. host_ref.cpp makes the same choice for the same reason and the two must
 * agree, or a temperature-0 request stops matching a greedy run.
 *
 * PARAMETERS ARE DATA, NOT BRANCHES. Sequences in one batch have different sampling parameters,
 * so the parameters are a device-side per-sequence array built once per step from a pinned
 * staging buffer -- the same discipline the step batch uses (spec §8). A kernel that branched on
 * a host-side parameter would need one launch per distinct parameter set, which at batch 256 is
 * up to 256 launches for what is one kernel's worth of work.
 *
 * THE SCHEMA THIS DRIVER ISSUES AGAINST (docs/OPS.md, "Sampling"). No per-sequence value is an
 * op PARAMETER, because parameters are geometry -- the thing the selector matches constraints
 * against and freezes at declare. A per-sequence value cannot live there: two requests in one
 * batch with different top_p would be two different geometries and therefore two different
 * resolutions of the same op. The seed and output position `sample_pick` draws from are in the
 * parameter row too. So every sampler op takes the row array as an operand:
 *
 *   sample_penalties   M(range) n_vocab vocab_off?   logits, params, history  -> logits (inout)
 *   sample_dry         M(range) n_vocab vocab_off?   logits, params, history, breakers?
 *                                                                          -> logits (inout)
 *   sample_temp        M(range) n_vocab   logits, params                  -> logits (inout)
 *   sample_mask        M(range) n_vocab   logits, params, bitmask         -> logits (inout)
 *   sample_topk        M(range) n_vocab vocab_off?   logits, params       -> cand_idx, cand_val,
 *                                                                             pairs?
 *   sample_argmax      M(range) n_vocab   logits, params                  -> token
 *   sample_topp        M(range) n_cand    cand_idx, cand_val, params      -> cand_idx, cand_val
 *   sample_minp        M(range) n_cand    cand_idx, cand_val, params      -> cand_idx, cand_val
 *   sample_typical     M(range) n_cand    cand_idx, cand_val, params      -> cand_idx, cand_val
 *   sample_xtc         M(range) n_cand    cand_idx, cand_val, params      -> cand_idx, cand_val
 *   sample_pick        M(range) n_cand    cand_idx, cand_val, params      -> token
 *   sample_merge_topk  M(range) n_cand    gathered, params                -> cand_idx, cand_val
 *
 * `M` is the number of SAMPLED POSITIONS, not tokens: one per sequence at decode, n_spec+1 per
 * sequence at a verify. `params` is [M] rows of DeviceSampleParams below; `history` is
 * [M, max_hist] int32 of GLOBAL token ids, row m addressed by row m's hist_off/hist_len;
 * `breakers` is [M, max_hist] uint8 beside it, nonzero where that position's token is a whole DRY
 * sequence breaker; `bitmask` is [M, mask_words] uint32 addressed by the row's mask_row.
 * `vocab_off` is this rank's first vocabulary row and is declared only when the vocabulary is
 * split: the three ops that turn a token id into a column of this rank's logits subtract it.
 * Every one of these has a libref implementation: a sampler with no ref implementation has no
 * fallback and no oracle (spec §17).
