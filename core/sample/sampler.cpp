/* ================================================================== grammar triggers
 *
 * A chat template names its triggers the way a person would -- "the call starts at the word
 * <tool_call>" -- while GbnfGrammar wants them in the two forms it checks as tokens arrive: token
 * ids to compare against the id just emitted, and literal words to find in the emitted bytes.
 * The translation needs a vocabulary, so it happens here and not in the server.
 *
 * A WORD IS A TOKEN WHEN THE VOCABULARY SAYS SO. The word is tokenised with special tokens
 * recognised, since a template's markers are usually special tokens and a split of `<tool_call>`
 * into `<`, `tool`, `_call`, `>` is not what the model emits. One token makes an id trigger, which
 * costs a comparison; anything longer is scanned for as bytes, because the tokeniser may split it
 * differently depending on what came before it. Getting this wrong does not fail loudly -- it
 * yields a trigger that never fires, so the call comes out unconstrained, which reads as a model
 * that writes malformed calls.
 *
 * A REGULAR-EXPRESSION TRIGGER IS REFUSED. Its matcher would run over the reply once per token
 * on the scheduler thread; the templates in service all trigger on words. A request whose
 * template needs one is refused at admission, naming the pattern. */
