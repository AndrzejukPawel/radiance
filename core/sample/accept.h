/* accept.h -- speculative acceptance. Verification is a declared op; ACCEPTANCE IS CORE SAMPLER
 * LOGIC (spec §10), which is why it lives here beside the chain that produced the distributions
 * it compares.
 *
 * Three rules, and the cheapest one is exact everywhere.
 *
 * AGREEMENT WITH THE TARGET'S OWN TOKEN -- what accept_greedy below actually implements, and what
 * this engine uses. A drafted token is accepted when it equals the token the target produced at
 * that position. At temperature 0 that token is the argmax, which is where the name came from.
 * ABOVE ZERO IT IS THE TARGET'S SAMPLED DRAW, AND ACCEPTING ON IT IS STILL EXACT -- provided each
 * verified position draws from its own RNG coordinate, which core/sample/sampler.cpp guarantees
 * (`p.pos = n_out + k`). Then the target's draw at position k is the one its own distribution
 * specifies there, the first emitted token is that draw whether the draft agreed or not, and every
 * later position is conditioned on a prefix accepted only because it matched. The emitted sequence
 * is a draw from the target, not an approximation of one.
 *
 * Exact given the same logits -- which is not the same as byte-identical to a non-speculative run,
 * because a verify step's logits are computed at a different M than a decode step's. The text
 * matches exactly at temperature 0 and mostly above it. See Engine::collect_step.
 *
 * What it costs is acceptance RATE: P(y == x) rather than the optimal min(1, p/q). What it costs
 * in machinery is nothing, which is why the engine computes no probability planes for it.
 *
 * ACCEPTING ON ARGMAX AT A POSITIVE TEMPERATURE is the rule that is NOT exact -- it replaces the
 * target's distribution with its mode. That is a different thing from the above, and the two are
 * easy to conflate.
 *
 * REJECTION SAMPLING. At temperature > 0 the drafted token x is accepted with probability
 * min(1, p(x)/q(x)) where p is the target's filtered distribution and q the drafter's. On
 * rejection the emitted token is drawn from the residual, norm(max(0, p - q)), which is what
 * makes the whole scheme emit exactly the target's distribution. With a GREEDY DRAFTER q is a
 * point mass, so the accept probability collapses to p(x) and the residual is p with x removed
 * and the rest renormalised -- which is the case the fast path is written for.
 *
 * Worth stating plainly because it looks like a regression and is not: acceptance FALLS relative
 * to greedy-against-greedy, because a proposal the target agrees with is still only accepted with
 * probability p(x) rather than always. That is the price of emitting the target's true
 * distribution.
 *
 * WHAT THE ANSWER IS FOR. `n_accepted` is consumed by two components that do different things
 * with it. The scheduler frees paged KV blocks past the accepted position -- a slot-table edit.
 * The linear-attention kernels do NOT recompute: the recurrent state and the conv window have
 * already absorbed the rejected tokens, and libr4d handles that by treating the conv state cache
 * as a rolling window of `conv_width-1 + n_spec` entries and READING AT THE SLOT THE LAST
 * ACCEPTED TOKEN LEFT. A rejection is a change of read offset, not a recompute, and `num_accepted`
 * is a required operand of `gdn_conv_update` and `gdn_recurrent_update` for exactly that reason
 * (docs/OPS.md, spec §10).
