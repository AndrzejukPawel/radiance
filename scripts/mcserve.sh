# Bring up MiniCPM5-2B (fp8) as a long-lived server and LEAVE IT RUNNING.
#
# The sibling of scripts/fnserve.sh, for the small dense model. Same contract: start it, wait for
# /health, print the endpoints, exit with the server still up. Stop it with scripts/fnstop.sh.
#
# WHY THE VRAM FLAGS ARE ABSENT. This is a DENSE model, so every weight is static and the
# planner takes it off the top as a floor; --expert-vs-cache-ratio then divides an elastic pool
# that has no expert side to claim it, and the slack crosses over to the cache. Stating
# --vram-weights-mib here would only cap what does not need capping.
#
# WHY 131072 AND NOT 200000. n_ctx_train is 131072 for this checkpoint; the 200K context
# scripts/fnserve.sh serves is a property of the Flash-Next model, which a 2B model cannot honour.
#
# KV is 21.0 KiB a token at fp8 (42 layers x 2 kv heads x 128 x 2 planes), halved per rank at
# tp 2, so a full-length sequence costs 1.38 GiB a rank and 8 of them do not fit -- the pool is
# a capacity, not a per-request reservation, and it backs however many the cache can hold.
