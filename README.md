# radiance

An LLM inference server for AMD GPUs, in C++ and HIP, with an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API. Model
architectures, kernel libraries and quantisers are `.so` plugins; the ones in this tree are built
and loaded the same way a third party's are ([`docs/PLUGIN.md`](docs/PLUGIN.md)).

The bundled device kernels (`libr4d`) target **AMD RDNA4** (`gfx1200`, `gfx1201`). The serve flags
below are for **two 32 GB cards** (Radeon AI PRO R9700). The engine itself starts on any AMD GPU
family; another card needs a kernel library for it. A machine with no GPU builds the host backend,
which runs the full test suite but does not serve these models at any useful speed.

A container holds everything the server needs: the weights, the tokeniser, the chat template and
any drafter. Each download link's repository has the recipe and the exact command that made the
file. Download one into your models directory (the transfer resumes if interrupted):

```sh
mkdir -p /srv/models/rad && cd /srv/models/rad
curl -LC - -O https://huggingface.co/StillDeadcode/minicpm5-2b-fp8/resolve/main/minicpm5-2b-fp8.rad
```

## Run with Docker

The host needs Docker and an `amdgpu` driver that supports ROCm 7.2; it does not need ROCm. The
image is [`stilldeadcode/radiance`](https://hub.docker.com/r/stilldeadcode/radiance), with its
kernels built for `gfx1201`. Pull it, then start a model from its compose file:

```sh
docker pull stilldeadcode/radiance
cp -r deploy/compose ~/radiance-compose && cd ~/radiance-compose
cp .env.example .env                         # set RADIANCE_MODELS, RADIANCE_STATE, RADIANCE_API_KEY, the GIDs
docker compose -f minicpm5-2b.yaml up -d     # or any file from the table
docker compose -f minicpm5-2b.yaml logs -f
docker compose -f minicpm5-2b.yaml down
```

Every model uses both cards and the same port, so run one at a time. Running without compose, and
the reason for each `docker run` option, is in [`docs/DOCKER.md`](docs/DOCKER.md).

To build the image yourself, for example for other cards, run `docker/build.sh -t 'gfx1200;gfx1201'`
(it needs `docker buildx` and tests the build as it goes). Then set `RADIANCE_IMAGE=radiance:latest`
in `.env`.

## Build from source

You need Linux, a C++20 compiler, CMake 3.21+ and Ninja. For the device kernels you also need ROCm
7.2 (`hipcc`; set `ROCM_PATH` if it is not `/opt/rocm`).

```sh
./build.sh                                   # configure, build for the cards present, run the tests
./build.sh --no-hip                          # host backend only
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DRAD_GPU_TARGETS='gfx1201'   # build for cards this machine lacks
cmake --install build --prefix /opt/radiance # optional; bin/, include/, share/radiance/
```

## Run without Docker

```sh
export RADIANCE_HOME=$PWD/build/radiance_home   # the plugins; an installed prefix finds its own
build/bin/radiance --model /srv/models/rad/minicpm5-2b-fp8.rad --port 8000 <flags>
```

These are the flags each model is served with. They match its compose file, minus Flash-Next's
prefix-cache tiers:

| model | flags |
|---|---|
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next | `--tp 2 --tp-wire wht6 --max-num-seqs 8 --max-model-len 200000 --placement expert_tiered --host-pool-mib 12288 --gpu-headroom-mib 96 --expert-vs-cache-ratio 0.82 --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --num-speculative-tokens 3 --max-num-batched-tokens 2048` |
| Qwen3.8-27B FP8, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | `--tp 2 --max-num-seqs 32 --max-model-len 200000 --kv-cache-dtype fp8` |
| Qwen3.8-27B bf16 | `--tp 2 --max-num-seqs 8 --max-model-len 200000 --kv-cache-dtype fp8` |
| MiniCPM5-2B FP8 and bf16 | `--tp 2 --max-num-seqs 32 --max-model-len 131072 --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --gpu-headroom-mib 160 --max-num-batched-tokens 512` |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next bf16 | `--tp 2 --max-model-len 32768 --placement expert_tiered --weights-disk-tier --host-pool-mib 12288 --gpu-headroom-mib 768 --deterministic --max-num-seqs 32 --max-num-batched-tokens 32768 --num-speculative-tokens 0` |

Every model serves up to 32 sequences a step. Two rows keep 8, because on a hybrid model each
sequence holds its own recurrent state and 32 of them leave the attention cache short of one
200K-token request: Flash-Next at ratio 0.82 (`--max-num-seqs 32 --expert-vs-cache-ratio 0.78`
keeps the 200K request and costs single-stream decode about 15%) and the 27B in bf16. See
[`docs/GUIDE.md`](docs/GUIDE.md) §4.4.

Add `--api-key KEY` to require `Authorization: Bearer KEY`. Add `--debug-graph` to print every op
and the kernel it resolved to, then exit without serving. Then:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":50}'
```

`http://localhost:8000/` is the dashboard. [`docs/GUIDE.md`](docs/GUIDE.md) covers the API, memory
budgets, long context, speculative decoding and operating a server.

## Convert a checkpoint

`rad-convert` turns a Hugging Face checkpoint into a container, quantising what a recipe in
`data/recipes/` names. Download checkpoints with `scripts/hfget.sh <org/repo> <dir>`.

```sh
build/bin/rad-convert ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B -o qwen3.8-27b-bf16.rad \
    --recipe data/recipes/q38-27b-bf16.recipe
build/bin/rad-convert ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next -o qwen3.8-flash-next-bf16.rad --max-ctx 4096
```

With Docker, use `docker run --rm -v ~/models:/models --entrypoint rad-convert stilldeadcode/radiance ...`. In
the image the recipes are in `/opt/radiance/share/radiance/recipes/`. A checkpoint served at its own
precision needs no container: `radiance --model ~/models/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8`.

## Test

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -LE 'gpu|oot'   # everything that runs without a card (a few minutes)
ctest --test-dir build -L gpu          # device suites; they need the cards to themselves
ctest --test-dir build -L oot          # rebuilds every bundled plugin out of tree against an install
```
