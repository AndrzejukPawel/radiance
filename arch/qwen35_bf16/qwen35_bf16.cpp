/* qwen35_bf16 -- Qwen3.5 / 3.6 / 3.8 dense, bf16 weights and bf16 activations.
 *
 * Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6 and Qwen3.8 dense models all report the architecture id `qwen35`, and
 * `qwen35moe` is the same graph with a routed FFN. Dimensions come from model metadata, so this
 * one file serves every size in the family -- 0.8B through 27B. docs/ARCHITECTURES.md has the
 * geometry and the traps that stay plausible when they are wrong.
 *
 * One plugin implements one architecture id for one quantisation scheme (spec §2.4). A
 * `qwen35_w8a8` sibling is a different directory that composes the same blocks against
 * rmsnorm_had_quant_i8, gemm_nt_q and gdn_gated_norm_had_quant_i8 -- not a branch in here. That is
 * why the declare function below is a list of what runs, in order, with no branch on quant in it.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT SERVES ==============================
 *
 * The unquantised release -- Qwen3.8-27B in bf16, quantisation descriptor "" -- served at its own
 * precision: every projection a bf16 GEMM. The block-scaled fp8 release is qwen35_fp8's, which
 * declares the same graph over fp8 linears. The lm_head here is declared at whatever the model
 * holds it as, so a container whose recipe made it block fp8 reads it through the fp8 logits
 * kernel and a checkpoint loaded as it stands through the bf16 one.
 *
 * ============================== THE SHAPE, AT 27B ==============================
 *
 *   64 layers, full_attention_interval 4 -> layers 3,7,...,63 are FULL ATTENTION (16 of them),
 *                                           the other 48 are GATED DELTA NET
 *   hidden 5120   ffn 17408   vocab 248320   (lm_head NOT tied)
 *   24 heads / 4 kv heads / head_dim 256  -> GQA 6, and head_dim is READ, not derived:
 *                                            n_embd / n_head is 213 and every shape after it
 *                                            would be wrong.
 *   attn_output_gate -> q_proj is [n_embd, 2 * n_head * head_dim], query and gate interleaved
 *   partial_rotary_factor 0.25 -> MROPE over the first 64 of 256 head dims, theta 1e7
 *   linear: 16 key heads / 48 value heads of 128, conv width 4, fp32 recurrent state
 *
 * ============================== WHAT THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT DECLARE ==============================
 *
 * The MTP / NextN head (one extra decoder block plus fc, enorm, hnorm) is real scope and is NOT
 * here. It does not block text generation, and it has to be declared from tensor names read off
 * the checkpoint -- a name map written from memory is a model that loads half its weights and
 * says nothing. It sits BESIDE the trunk under an `mtp.` prefix of its own, so
 * `nextn_predict_layers` is not subtracted from the layer count (see declare()), and declaring
 * the MTP block as a trunk layer would run it in the main pass, which is a different model.
 *
 * The VISION TOWER (27 blocks, hidden 1152, 16 heads of 72, patch 16, out 5120) is declared
 * through arch/common/rad_block_vit.h, only when the container carries one and the deployment
 * asked for media.
