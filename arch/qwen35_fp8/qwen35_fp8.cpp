/* qwen35_fp8 -- Qwen3.5 / 3.6 / 3.8 dense, BLOCK-SCALED FP8 weights and FP8 activations.
 *
 * The sibling of qwen35_bf16 and the one that serves the production checkpoint. Same architecture,
 * same graph, same metadata, same name maps for everything that is not a projection matrix -- so
 * the architecture prose lives in qwen35_bf16.cpp and in the three block headers, and this file
 * says only what makes it a different plugin. One plugin implements one architecture id for one
 * quantisation scheme (spec §2.4), and this is the second scheme.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT SERVES ==============================
 *
 * A checkpoint whose config.json carries
 *
 *     "quantization_config": { "quant_method": "fp8", "fmt": "e4m3",
 *                              "activation_scheme": "dynamic",
 *                              "weight_block_size": [128, 128] }
 *
 * which is Qwen3.8-27B-FP8, Qwen3.6-27B-FP8 and every other DeepSeek-style fp8 release of this
 * family. Each large linear ships as `<name>.weight` in F8_E4M3 [N][K] beside
 * `<name>.weight_scale_inv` in BF16 [ceil(N/128)][ceil(K/128)] -- the codes and the scale plane
 * of one weight, `fp8_e4m3*bf16[128x128]`, which libr4d's three block-scaled fp8 GEMMs read as
 * they are, so the checkpoint loads directly and a .rad of it costs what the checkpoint does.
 *
 * qwen35_bf16's header argues for widening to bf16 instead, and that argument holds only where
 * libr4d's registry exposes no fp8-weight GEMM. It does expose them (libr4d/r4d_fp8.cpp), so the
 * widening is not the cheaper path here: it doubles 24 GiB of weights to 48 GiB to buy nothing.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS AND IS NOT FP8 ==============================
 *
 * Read off `layers-0.safetensors` and `layers-3.safetensors` rather than assumed, because the
 * pattern is not "the big ones":
 *
 *   F8_E4M3 + scale   self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj, mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj,
 *                     linear_attn.{in_proj_qkv, in_proj_z, out_proj}
 *   BF16, no scale    every norm, A_log, dt_bias, conv1d, embed_tokens, lm_head, AND
 *                     linear_attn.in_proj_a / in_proj_b
 *
 * in_proj_a and in_proj_b emit one column per value head -- 48 of them -- and 48 is not a whole
 * 128-row scale block, so the quantiser that made the checkpoint left them alone. That is why
 * GdnFP8 splits the in-projection the bf16 block fuses; rad_block_gdn_fp8.h has the detail.
 *
 * The lm_head being bf16 in the checkpoint is worth stating too. It is declared at whatever the
 * model holds it as -- bf16 loaded directly, block fp8 where a recipe quantised it -- and the
 * logits kernel that reads that encoding is the one selected.
 */
/* ============================== ONE SOURCE, TWO PLUGINS ==============================
 *
 * `qwen35moe` is this architecture with the feed-forward ROUTED and everything above it identical:
 * the same gated attention, the same gated delta net, the same layer schedule, the same rope, the
 * same vocabulary edges, the same MTP head in the same position. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-FP8 is the model,
 * and reading its config beside Qwen3.8-27B-FP8's the only structural difference is `mlp.experts.*`
 * plus a router and a shared expert where `mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj` was.
 *
 * So there is ONE source and two translation units, exactly as libr4d's attention dispatches are
 * one set of kernel templates instantiated at three geometries. arch/qwen35moe_fp8/ is four lines
 * that define the three macros below and include this file. The alternative is a second 1300-line
 * plugin kept in step by hand, and two hand-kept copies of one thing drift apart -- the reason
 * libr4d/r4d_rows.cpp keeps exactly one table of its kernels.
 *
 * EVERY DIFFERENCE IS BEHIND `#if QWEN35_MOE` AND THERE ARE SIX OF THEM: the expert-count check,
 * the routing geometry read out of metadata, the block's buffers, the per-layer source names, the
 * MTP head's feed-forward, and the plugin's own identity. Nothing else in this file knows. */

     * --kv-cache-dtype fp8 MAKES IT E4M3, AND IT IS THE ONE KNOB HERE THAT IS WORTH REAL TIME
     * AT DEPTH. The attention cache is
     * `n_head_kv * head_dim * 2` bytes a token a layer -- 2 KiB a rank on this model -- and ONLY
     * the 16 attention layers pay it, because the 48 delta-net layers carry fixed-size state
     * instead. At eight sequences of 16k that is 4.3 GB of read traffic a step, which is most of
     * what depth costs at that concurrency, and halving the width halves it. It also halves what a
     * sequence costs in --vram-kv-mib, which is context and batch size as well as time.
     *
     * IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT ON A QUALITY ARGUMENT, not as a precaution. Greedy continuations from a
     * long prompt agree between bf16 and fp8 for the first few hundred tokens and then diverge,
     * and the fp8 side can produce syntactically broken code where the bf16 side stays clean --
     * and this model is a CODER, so that is the workload.
     *
     * Comparing the two formats takes more than a byte comparison: a few hundred tokens of
     * agreement is not evidence that survives a longer sample, and once the text moves the only
     * question left is whether what it moved to is WORSE, which needs reading and more than one
     * prompt. Alternate the two -- bf16 / fp8 / bf16 / fp8 -- so a difference between the FORMATS
     * can be told from a difference between two runs of one.
     *
     * `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` turns it on. The descales stay at libr4d's default of 1.0, which is
     * vLLM's default too; the kernels index them per (sequence, head), so a calibrated pair needs
     * no different mechanism.
     *
     * Nothing else moves with it: the fp8kv attention rows and their `k_descale` / `v_descale`
     * operands are in libr4d, the core sizes a page from the group's own dtype, and
     * `kv_store_fp8` is the write side. The drafter's cache takes the same width

 *
 * An MTP head is SERIAL: depth d is d chained forward passes, each one embedding the token the

 * Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 at two ranks throughput is flat across depths 2, 3 and 4 and falls away after,
 * so 3 is the top of that plateau.
 *
 * DFlash2 is block-diffusion and proposes the WHOLE block in one pass, so its depth is not a
 * throughput trade at all: it is the block length the checkpoint was trained at, and asking for
 * anything else is a silently worse draft. This one ships trained at block_size 8, which is one
 * anchor and 7 mask positions.
