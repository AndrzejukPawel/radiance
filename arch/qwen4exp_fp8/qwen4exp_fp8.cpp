/* qwen4exp_fp8 -- Qwen4-Exp (`model_type: qwen4_exp`), the architecture Qwen3.8-Flash-Next ships
 * and the one Qwen says Qwen4 will be built on. DENSE bf16 checkpoint, quantised by a recipe ahead
 * of time (data/recipes/qwen4exp-w4nl64-i8-hc8m.recipe is the served one): int8 or fp8 trunk
 * linears with activations of the same kind, four-bit routed experts, or bf16 throughout.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT IS, RELATIVE TO WHAT ALREADY RUNS ==============================
 *
 * In transformers it is `Qwen4ExpTextModel`, a subclass of `Qwen3_5MoeTextModel` -- and this tree
 * already serves that (arch/qwen35moe_fp8, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-FP8). So most of this file is
 * composition over the same blocks, and what is genuinely new is small and named:
 *
 *   SAME, reused as-is          the Gated DeltaNet (conv width 4, key/value head dim 128), the
 *                              GATED full attention (`attn_output_gate`, q_proj twice as wide,
 *                              half of it a sigmoid gate on the attention output), partial rotary
 *                              (64 of 256 dims), the routed feed-forward with a shared expert and
 *                              its own sigmoid gate, the MTP position.
 *   NEW, in this tree           the GATED RESIDUAL (arch/common/rad_block_hc.h), the n-gram / PLE
 *                              layer (arch/common/rad_block_ple.h), QSA's indexer
 *                              (arch/common/rad_qsa.h), the STACKED dense expert tensors
 *                              (tools/rad_convert.cpp's slice_stacked), gqa 12, and the delta
 *                              net's SIGMOID output gate. The last two sections of this comment
 *                              say what the first two of those are for.
 *
 * Qwen3.8-Flash-Next: 48 layers of 12 x (3 x GatedDeltaNet -> MoE, then 1 x QSA -> MoE), hidden
 * 2560, hc_count 4 so the residual stream is 10240, 512 experts of 640 at top-10 plus a shared 640,
 * 24 query heads and 2 KV heads at head_dim 256, vocab 248320.
 *
 * ============================== THE RESIDUAL STREAM IS FOUR TIMES AS WIDE ==============================
 *
 * There is no `input_layernorm`, no `post_attention_layernorm` and no final `norm` in this
 * checkpoint. In their place every block has a GATED RESIDUAL connection -- a grouped norm over a
 * 10240 stream, a low-rank data-dependent read gate that mixes the four sub-streams down to 2560,
 * and four data-dependent scalars that gain the block's output back into all four. 96 of them, plus
 * a 97th with no write half that collapses the stream for the lm_head.
 *
 * arch/common/rad_block_hc.h holds the arithmetic and docs/OPS.md's `hc_read` / `hc_write` rows
 * hold the schema. What matters HERE is that the blocks do not own their norms: this plugin
 * passes `Src::norm = nullptr`, which is the three fp8 blocks' "the input is already normed and
 * quantised" mode, and it therefore also gives up the two fusions that mode is built on -- the
 * residual add folded into the next norm, and the all-reduce folded into it. The all-reduce rides
 * in the gated residual's write instead, wherever a kernel serves that (HyperConn::Config::reduce,
 * see declare()).
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS AND IS NOT FP8 ==============================
 *
 * The checkpoint is bf16 THROUGHOUT -- it carries no `quantization_config` at all -- so this
 * plugin's quantisation descriptor is the EMPTY one and the formats it serves are made by a
 * recipe (data/recipes/qwen4exp-*.recipe). The plugin reads each weight's encoding and declares
 * what that is; the blocks that read a weight in more than one format choose their ops by it:
 *
 *   block fp8 or int8  self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj, linear_attn.{in_proj_qkv, in_proj_z, out_proj},
 *                      the shared expert's three (LinearFP8); the indexer's qk projection
 *                      unless the recipe leaves it bf16, as the served one does
 *   fp8, four-bit      every routed expert's gate_up and down, each layer and projection in its
 *   or bf16            own form (MoeFP8::probe)
 *   E4M3 rows or bf16  each connection's input_mix_weight_{down,up}, whose lowrank of 320 is 2.5
 *                      scale blocks and so is scaled a row group at a time (HyperConn), and the
 *                      MTP head's fc_hidden / fc_embedding
 *   fp8, int8, bf16    the lm_head (whichever logits_gemm kernel reads it)
 *   BF16               every norm gain, A_log, dt_bias, conv1d, in_proj_a / in_proj_b (48 rows is
 *                      not a whole scale block), the router, shared_expert_gate, embed_tokens,
 *                      the PLE projections and inject weights
 *
 * ============================== HOW TENSOR PARALLEL SPLITS AN EXPERT ==============================
 *
 * `moe_intermediate_size` is 640 = 5 x 128. A rank's even share at tp2 is 320, which is NOT a whole
 * number of 128-column blocks -- the fp8 scale block, the 4-bit scale group and the rotation all
 * sit on them. So each rank takes three blocks of the experts of one parity and two of the
 * other's, the router stays replicated so both ranks agree on the routing, each rank computes its
 * slice of every routed expert, and THE BLOCK'S EXISTING END-OF-BLOCK ALL-REDUCE SUMS THE
 * PARTIALS. No all-to-all, no extra collective. The section in declare() carries the detail, and
 * why this is preferred to splitting the experts themselves between the ranks.
 *
 * ============================== PLE AND QSA ==============================
 *
 * PLE / THE N-GRAM EMBEDDING is 51B of the model's 180B parameters -- a 320,001,536-row table of
 * 160-dim embeddings, gathered 16 rows a token by a hash of the last three token ids, read once at
 * layer 1 and injected into the wide stream. Without it this is a 125B model missing a third of
 * its parameters.
 *
 * QSA'S INDEXER picks the best `indexer_budget / indexer_compress_ratio` = 512 blocks of 4 tokens
 * for each query and attends to those alone. Below `indexer_budget + indexer_compress_ratio - 1` =
 * 2051 tokens of context EVERY complete block is selected, so QSA is DENSE CAUSAL ATTENTION bit
 * for bit -- which is the oracle any change to it is checked against, and is also why the engine
 * issues the cheaper dense attention there. Above it the selection is per QUERY on both paths
 * (docs/QSA.md, arch/common/rad_qsa.h), so a long prompt is prefilled with the model's own
 * attention and not a denser stand-in.
 *
 * The vision tower is declared through arch/common/rad_block_vit.h, only when the container
 * carries one and the deployment asked for media; rad-convert writes only declared weights.
