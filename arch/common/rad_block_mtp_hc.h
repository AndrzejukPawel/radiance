/* rad_block_mtp_hc.h -- the multi-token-prediction head of a model whose residual stream is `hc`
 * times the model width.
 *
 * ============================== WHY THIS IS NOT rad_block_mtp_fp8.h ==============================
 *
 * That file serves Qwen3.5 / Qwen3-Next / Qwen3.6, where the head is a PRE-NORM transformer layer
 * that reads the trunk's [n_embd] hidden state. It is the same idea, the same indexing and the
 * same two kinds of pass -- and almost none of the same parts, because Qwen4-Exp's head lives in
 * the WIDE stream:
 *
 *   ITS INPUT IS 10240 WIDE      `mtp.pre_fc_norm_hidden.weight` is [hc * n_embd], so the hidden
 *                               state this head continues from is the trunk's wide stream BEFORE
 *                               the output mixer collapses it, not `last_hidden_state`.
 *   THERE ARE TWO fc MATRICES    `mtp.fc_hidden` and `mtp.fc_embedding`, both [n_embd, n_embd].
 *                               So there is no concatenation and no concat-ORDER question: the
 *                               hidden half is one square matrix applied to EACH sub-stream and
 *                               the embedding half is one product broadcast into all of them.
 *                               docs/OPS.md's `mtp_enter` row is that arithmetic.
 *   ITS LAYER HAS TWO GATED      `mtp.layers.0.attn_hyper_connection` and `.mlp_hyper_connection`,
 *   RESIDUALS, NOT TWO NORMS     exactly as a trunk layer does. There is no `input_layernorm` and
 *                               no `post_attention_layernorm` in this checkpoint at all.
 *   AND A MIXER OF ITS OWN       `mtp.hyper_connection_mixer` -- a connection with no write half,
 *                               which is what collapses the head's wide stream for the lm_head.
 *                               It is the 98th connection in the model and the trunk's 97th has
 *                               the same shape and the same absent `block_inject_weight`.
 *
 * What is NOT different is the part that is easy to get wrong, so it is restated here in full.
 *
 * ============================== THE INDEXING ==============================
 *
 *     head index i    reads  hidden(i) and embed(token at i + 1)
 *                     writes its K and V at KV position i, with rope position i
 *                     predicts the token at i + 2
 *
 * DeepSeek-V3's MTP layout, which this family follows: the head's transformer block runs over the
 * SAME position indices as the trunk and the shift lives entirely in which token gets embedded.
 * Getting it off by one costs nothing visible -- the drafts are simply wrong, acceptance collapses,
 * and the model's own output stays exactly correct.
 *
 * ============================== THE TWO KINDS OF PASS ==============================
 *
 * `RadBatch::draft_pass` says which and the SIGN is the whole distinction:
 *
 *   < 0   A HISTORY PASS, one row a token, continuing from the trunk's own wide stream. The
 *         head's attention reads its OWN K and V for every earlier position and nothing else in
 *         the engine writes those -- the trunk's prefill fills layers 0..n-1 and leaves the head's
 *         untouched. Without it the head attends to whatever the pool last held, which is not
 *         wrong output (a bad draft is only a rejected draft) but is a drafter that proposes noise.
 *         It is also DRAFT ROUND 1 for the sequences that draft: each one's last history row is
 *         the committed position with the token the trunk chose after it, which is round 1's
 *         whole input, so the pass ends in the lm_head over those rows (RadBatch::draft_out_ids)
 *         and hands their wide state on as the carry.
 *   > 1   A DRAFT ROUND, one row a sequence, continuing from the head's own stream. There is no
 *         round-1 pass; the history pass is it.
 *
 * ============================== THE CARRY, AND WHY IT IS A COPY ==============================
 *
 * `hin` is what a round continues FROM and `hw` is the head's own stream. They cannot be one
 * buffer: `mtp_enter` reads the whole wide row to produce every channel of its output, so a
 * workgroup writing channels 0..31 would clobber input another workgroup has not read yet. The
 * pre-norm head has no such problem because its carry is written by a DIFFERENT op at the end of
 * the round (`mtp.norm`), and here the end of the round is the mlp connection's write, in place.
 *
 * So one `cast` copies `hw` back to `hin` between rounds -- a 20 KB row copy at decode, whose cost
 * is its launch -- and it is SKIPPED on the last round because nothing reads it there. A history
 * pass that drafts takes its carry with a `gather_rows` instead, of the round-1 rows alone, and
 * copies them back to the front of `hw`, where the mixer reads a round's rows.
 *
 * ============================== THE KV CACHE ==============================
 *
 * The head's attention layer is bound to the TRUNK'S full-attention group as one more layer, at
 * absolute index n_layer. The slot mapping and the block table are the trunk's, so the head writes
 * its K and V at the slot the trunk's token for that position occupies and A REJECTED DRAFT'S
 * ENTRY IS OVERWRITTEN BY THE NEXT STEP'S CORRECT TOKEN AT THE SAME ADDRESS. Draft rounds run in
 * position order and each writes its own position before attending to it, so there is no rollback
 * to get wrong. The cost is that the group's page grows from 12 layers to 13 -- 8% more attention
 * KV -- and it is paid only when the deployment declares speculation.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS AND IS NOT DECLARED ==============================
 *
 * The head reuses the TRUNK'S working buffers for its layer -- `attn_qg`, the expert planes, the
 * narrow block input. Every one of them is dead by the time a draft round runs (the trunk step has
 * been sampled and committed) and a second set would be 150 MiB of activation planes for one
 * layer. Only the wide stream, the carry, the embedding and the head's own logits path are its
 * own, because those must survive the round that produced them.
 *
 * THIS BLOCK MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED AFTER THE TRUNK'S LAST OP. Declaration order IS the buffer
 * planner's liveness (core/build/rad_bufplan.cpp) and a drafter declared mid-trunk shares bytes
 * with buffers the trunk still has live. The signature of getting it wrong is fluent output with
 * acceptance EXACTLY zero.
