/* rad_block_dflash2.h -- the DFlash2 block-diffusion drafter, bf16.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT IS ==============================
 *
 * A SECOND, SMALLER TRANSFORMER that proposes a whole block of tokens in ONE forward pass. It is
 * the other drafter this engine serves, and it is a different shape of thing from the MTP head
 * beside it (rad_block_mtp_fp8.h):
 *
 *     MTP        depth d costs d CHAINED forwards. Round i+1 cannot start until round i has
 *                produced a token, because the token is what it embeds.
 *     DFlash2    depth d costs ONE forward over d+1 positions. The block is denoised together --
 *                the anchor token plus d mask tokens go in, d+1 hidden states come out.
 *
 * That is why depth is nearly free here and expensive there, and it is why this file has no
 * `draft_pass`: there are no rounds. Published acceptance for this drafter is 4.10-5.46 against
 * MTP's 3.74-5.02 at 7 drafts.
 *
 * The price of proposing the positions together is that position l+1 was computed WITHOUT KNOWING
 * what position l would choose. The candidate selector is what puts that dependence back: each
 * position keeps the draft head's top K, a low-rank bilinear form scores the edge between
 * consecutive positions, and a greedy walk picks one path. `dflash_select` is that kernel.
 *
 * ============================== THE TWO PASSES ==============================
 *
 * THE CONTEXT PASS, one row a committed token. The drafter never runs its layers over the context
 * -- it reads the TARGET's hidden states instead, at five intermediate layers, and turns them
 * straight into its own K and V:
 *
 *     c  = fc(concat of the trunk's residual stream at layers 5, 19, 33, 47, 61)   [n_taps*n_embd]
 *     c  = hidden_norm(c)
 *     for each draft layer:  k|v = kv_proj(c);  k = k_norm(k) then rope;  kv_store(k, v)
 *
 * The trunk's side of that -- the taps, and the `dflash_src` buffer they land in -- is in
 * qwen35_fp8.cpp. This file reads the buffer and never asks where the rows came from.
 *
 * THE QUERY PASS, one row a draft position, `block` = 1 + n_spec of them a sequence:
 *
 *     x = embed(anchor, mask, mask, ...)
 *     for each layer:
 *         h  = attn_norm(x);   coef = attn_conv_proj(h)
 *         h  = dflash_conv(h, coef[0:taps*NG], attn_conv_base[0])          <- prepare
 *         h  = o_proj(attention(q_proj(h), kv_proj(h)))                    <- non-causal, windowed
 *         h  = dflash_conv(h, coef[taps*NG:], attn_conv_base[1]);  x += h  <- finish
 *         h  = ffn_norm(x);    coef = ffn_conv_proj(h)
 *         h  = dflash_conv(h, coef[0:taps*NG], ffn_conv_base[0])
 *         h  = down(silu_mul(gate_up(h)))
 *         h  = dflash_conv(h, coef[taps*NG:], ffn_conv_base[1]);   x += h
 *     x = norm(x)
 *
 * and then, over the MASK rows of each sequence's block -- offsets 1..block-1, NOT 0..steps-1.
 * The anchor at offset 0 is a token the target has already chosen, so its row predicts nothing and
 * is there to condition the rest; each mask row predicts the token AT ITS OWN POSITION:
 *
 *     cand, unary = top_k(draft_head(x))          the candidates and their logits
 *     hp          = hidden_projection(x)          the selector's query, rank 256
 *     tokens      = dflash_select(cand, unary, hp, anchor, predecessor, successor)
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS SHARED WITH THE TARGET ==============================
 *
 * The embedding table and the lm_head, both. The checkpoint ships neither -- 81 tensors, no
 * `embed_tokens` and no `lm_head` -- so a drafter without a target is not a model. `mask_token_id`
 * is an ordinary id in the target's vocabulary (248070 here), which is why there is no separate
 * mask embedding to load.
 *
 * The head reads the 2-BIT copy of the lm_head, exactly as the MTP head does and for exactly the
 * reason rad_block_mtp_fp8.h gives at op_dlogits: a draft is a proposal, the target verifies every
 * one of them with its own untouched head, and speculative decoding is distribution-preserving --
 * so a coarser draft costs acceptance and cannot change a token the model emits. Here it also buys
 * something MTP does not need: the head stays a SINGLE-RANK computation, so the candidate ids are
 * global without an all-gather and the selector's codebooks can be indexed directly.
 *
 * ============================== THE NORMS ARE PLAIN ==============================
 *
 * `w`, not `1 + w`, unlike every norm in the trunk this drafter is bolted to. vLLM says so by
 * using the ordinary RMSNorm rather than the family's GemmaRMSNorm, and the checkpoint agrees:
 * hidden_norm sits at 0.11..1.24 (mean 0.82), input_layernorm at 0.05..1.70, k_norm at 0.32..2.53
 * and the final norm at 2.45..5.25. All positive, all centred near one -- which is a plain gain
 * and is not what a `1 + w` tensor looks like. So `Geom::wadd` and `wadd_qk` are ZERO here while
 * the trunk's are one, and the two geometries are separate structs for this reason among others.
 *
 * ============================== SHARDING ==============================
 *
 * The layers shard the way any transformer's do: q/kv and gate_up by row, o and down by column
 * with an all-reduce. Ten collectives a draft pass, each 5120 * block * 2 bytes -- 80 KiB at the
 * shipped block of 8 -- which is below the lossy wire's floor and is served exactly.
 *
 * THREE THINGS ARE REPLICATED AND EACH IS A DECISION:
 *
 *   fc              [n_embd, n_taps*n_embd], 262 MiB. It could be COLUMN-sharded, since its input
 *                   is the replicated residual stream and its output would then be a partial sum:
 *                   131 MiB a rank and half the read bytes on the context pass's widest GEMM. Not
 *                   done, because it puts an all-reduce on the PREFILL path to save a small
 *                   fraction of it, and the real fix for the context pass's cost is not to run it
 *                   over the whole prompt at all (see below).
 *   conv weights    the projection and the base kernel, 26 MiB a layer. The convolution is over
 *                   the whole replicated hidden row and every rank needs every coefficient; a row
 *                   shard would give each rank a fraction of the groups.
 *   the codebooks   [n_vocab, 256] each, 127 MiB each. They are gathered by GLOBAL token id and
 *                   the ids come out of a whole-vocabulary draft head, so a vocabulary shard would
 *                   let a rank score only the candidates that happened to land in its own slice.
 *                   The gather is 128 rows a pass, so the bytes READ are nothing; it is the
 *                   residency that costs.
 *
 * ============================== THE CONTEXT PASS IS THE EXPENSIVE HALF ==============================
 *
 * In bytes: `fc` is 262 MiB and the five KV projections read 3.4 GB over a 2048-token prefill
 * chunk, which is a real fraction of what the chunk costs.
 *
 * THE FIX IS NOT A FASTER GEMM. The drafter's attention has a 2048-token window, so a context
 * position more than 2048 before the query is never read: for a prompt of any real length, all but
 * the last 2048 rows of the context pass are computed and thrown away. The scheduler can simply
 * not run it over them. That is scheduler work and it is noted here rather than done here.

    /* THE 2-BIT DRAFT HEAD. The same declaration the MTP head makes, for the same reasons, argued
     * at length in rad_block_mtp_fp8.h: `dflash.draft_head.weight` is the target's lm_head under a
     * name of its own, which the recipe quantises to the 2-bit grid (u2 codes, an f16 scale and a
     * u8 zero a group of 128) -- one checkpoint tensor, two logical weights. The GEMM takes the
     * codes as one operand and the scale and zero planes, interleaved by its relayout, as the
     * other.
     *
     * IT IS SHARDED, AND THE MERGE IS WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE. The draft path never goes through the
     * sampler, so its argmax is a `row_topk` over one rank's plane -- and a sharded plane on its
     * own would let each rank propose only from its own half, while the selector's codebooks are
     * gathered by GLOBAL token id and would then see only the candidates that landed locally. The
     * merge runs BEFORE the selector: each rank's top-R comes back as global ids, an all_gather
     * moves R pairs a row, and `row_topk_merge` reduces them to the same global top-R an unsharded
     * head would have found -- exactly, ties included (docs/OPS.md). Both ranks then hold the same
     * candidate set and the codebooks are replicated, so everything downstream is unchanged.
     *
     * What it buys is the widest read on the draft path halved -- 341 MiB of codes and scales at
     * the whole vocabulary -- and that much device memory given back per rank. What it costs is
     * one all_gather of `world * R` pairs a row, which at R = 16 is 2 KiB: the link's latency and
     * essentially no bytes. */
