/* rad_block_ple.h -- Qwen4-Exp's Per-Layer Embedding, declared and issued.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT IS ==============================
 *
 * ONE layer of the model gets a second embedding table, addressed not by the token but by a HASH of
 * the last three. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's is 320,001,536 rows of 160 -- FOUR FIFTHS OF THE CHECKPOINT,
 * 51 of its 125 billion parameters -- read sixteen rows a token and mixed into the residual stream
 * by a dot product against the stream itself:
 *
 *   ids  = ngram_ids(tokens)                     [T, 16]   a hash of the last 3 ids, per head
 *   e    = embed_lookup_q(ids, table, scale)     [T, 2560]  16 x 160, flattened
 *   k    = key_proj(e)    [T, hc*n]              v = value_proj(e)    [T, n]
 *   gv,
 *   gvn  = ple_gate(k, h, v, ...)                the dot, the signed sqrt, the broadcast
 *   out  = ple_conv(gvn, resid = gv, ...)        dilated depthwise conv, silu, and the add
 *   h   += out
 *
 * and it happens BEFORE the attention hyper-connection reads the stream, so `h` here is the wide
 * un-normed residual.
 *
 * ============================== THE TABLE DECIDES THE SHAPE OF ALL OF THIS ======================
 *
 * 51.2 GB cannot be on the card and cannot be staged onto it, so `embed_lookup_q` runs on the HOST
 * over the container's own mmap and its result crosses the link once -- 5 KB a token at decode.
 * libavx/avx_ngram.cpp carries that argument in full. Three consequences reach this file:
 *
 *   THE TABLE IS A WEIGHT OPERAND, because the planner puts an op on the host only when every
 *   weight operand of it is Site::Host. A gather whose source were an activation could never be
 *   placed there.
 *
 *   ITS BUFFERS ARE HOST DOMAIN. `ids` and `e` are read and written by a host kernel, so they live
 *   in the host arena; everything downstream of `e` is ordinary device work.
 *
 *   IT IS 128 CHECKPOINT TENSORS. RadNameMap holds eight sources, so the map is declared in pieces
 *   by map_concat_shards() and the order IS the concatenation -- a permuted table is a model that
 *   loads, runs, and looks up the wrong embeddings.
 *
 * ============================== TWO STATES, ONE CONTRACT ==============================
 *
 * The n-gram hash needs the two committed ids in front of the step, and the convolution needs nine
 * timesteps of its input. Both are RAD_KV_CONV rolling windows read at `num_accepted - 1`. They
 * differ in ONE thing: the token window's cold value is EOS and the convolution's is zero, because
 * zero is a real token id. `has_init` says which slots are cold and both ops read it.
 *
 * WHAT A STEP LEAVES IN THE WINDOW DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF STEP IT WAS, and the op learns that
 * from whether `num_accepted` is passed (libref/ref_ple.cpp). A decode row may have its drafts
 * rejected, so its window is left in gdn_conv_update's shifted layout, where the next step's read
 * offset picks out the history ending at the last token kept. A prefill chunk commits everything,
 * so its window is its tail at offset zero, which the scheduler's `num_accepted` of 1 for the next
 * step reads. One layout cannot serve both: at offset zero the first holds the history ending at
 * the step's FIRST token and the second the history ending at its LAST. So step() issues both ops
 * once per half of the batch, the way rad_block_gdn_fp8.h issues its two convolutions.

    /* ============================== THE WHOLE LAYER IS REPLICATED UNDER TP ==============================
     *
     * Replication is the RIGHT answer here, not a gap: sharding would be the mistake.
     *
     * THE TABLE IS ADDRESSED BY A HASH OF THE TOKENS, which every rank computes identically, so a
     * vocabulary shard would give each rank rows it can never be asked for. And it costs NOTHING
     * to replicate: it is Tier::Mapped, read from the container's own file, so both ranks point at
     * the same table on the same machine and gather through one row cache they share.
     *
     * WHAT IS LEFT IS 63 MiB A RANK -- key_proj 50, value_proj 12.5, three norm gains and a conv
     * weight -- against the 112 GiB of experts TP exists to split here. Column-sharding the
     * projections would shard `gv` and `gvn` across the hyper-connection streams, and then the
     * convolution and the residual add would need the full width back: an all-gather a step, to
     * save 31 MiB a card. Geom::n_embd is "the residual stream, replicated on every rank", and
     * this layer reads and writes exactly that.
     *
     * SO EVERY RANK RUNS THE WHOLE LAYER AND THERE IS NO COLLECTIVE IN IT. Both ranks see the same
     * token ids, hash them the same way, gather the same rows and add the same `out` into their
     * own copy of a stream that was already identical -- bit for bit, because the all-reduce that
     * produced it delivers the same sum to both. The duplicated work is two small GEMMs and one
     * host gather per rank.
     *
     * ---- AND THAT LAST SENTENCE IS TRUE AT DECODE AND EXPENSIVE AT PREFILL ---------------------
     *
     * The duplicated gather is `heads` rows a TOKEN, so what is sixteen rows at a decode step is
     * sixteen thousand at a 1024-token chunk and thirty-two thousand at a 2048 one. A gather that
     * reads the table through the mapping costs each rank about 70 ms at a 2048-token chunk --
     * about 7.6% of a prefill step each. The RANKS ARE THREADS IN ONE PROCESS, so the page faults
     * are shared, but each rank still walks every row, and the step waits for both.
     *
     * THAT COST IS PAGE-TABLE POPULATION, NOT I/O. The distinct rows a prefill wants land on
     * distinct 4 KiB pages -- about ONE USEFUL ROW A PAGE, where a page holds 25 of them -- so a
     * gather through the mapping pays a fault per row. At decode, with varied text, it is the
     * other way round: half of every step's rows are new, and the page cache makes the waiting
     * thread start each of those reads itself. So the kernel keeps the rows in a cache of its own
     * and reads a miss straight from the file (libavx/avx_ngram.cpp).
     *
     * AND THAT CACHE SPLITS THE COLD WORK WITHOUT A COLLECTIVE. Dividing the rows between ranks,
     * or having one rank gather for both, would need a cross-rank HOST barrier inside a block that
     * deliberately has no collective in it. The shared cache does not: each rank claims the misses
     * it reaches first, reads only those, and waits only for rows the other rank has already
     * claimed -- so a miss is read once, and a late rank finds the rows there. What each rank still
     * does alone is decode the rows into its own output, which is a table lookup a byte. A
     * vocabulary shard is still wrong for the reason given above.

 * half, so a pure decode step is one launch and only a mixed step pays a second.
