/* rad_block_mlp_fp8.h -- the SwiGLU feed-forward block with block-scaled FP8 linears.
 *
 *   rmsnorm -> quant_act_fp8 -> gate_up gemm_nt_q -> silu_mul -> quant_act_fp8 -> down gemm_nt_q
 *   -> [all_reduce] -> residual add
 *
 * THE ARCHITECTURE IS rad_block_mlp.h's AND IS DOCUMENTED THERE -- the gate/up fusion, why the
 * all-reduce is emitted by the plugin, what the residual add is for. This file is that block with
 * two ops added and two changed, and it repeats none of it: a second copy of the prose is a second
 * thing to keep true.
 *
 * What differs, and only this:
 *
 *   - the two projections are LinearFP8 (rad_fp8.h): an E4M3 weight, a bf16 [N/128][K/128] scale
 *     plane declared as a weight of its own, and `gemm_nt_q` at dtype fp8a8 instead of `gemm_nt`.
 *   - each of them is preceded by a `quant_act_fp8` over its input, because an fp8a8 GEMM takes an
 *     E4M3 activation and the checkpoint's `activation_scheme` is `dynamic` -- there is no
 *     activation scale on disk and one is computed every step.
 *   - the norm, the activation and the collective are UNCHANGED. Activations between ops are still
 *     bf16; only the two GEMM operands are narrow. So `Geom::dtype` stays "bf16" for this block and
 *     every op in it but the two linears resolves exactly as it does in the bf16 plugin.
 *
 * The gate/up fusion survives the format, which is not obvious and is the reason it is kept: the
 * two sources are [17408,5120] each and their scale planes [136,40] each, and concatenating both
 * along dim 0 gives [34816,5120] against [272,40] -- which is the grid, because 34816/128 is 272.
 * A fusion whose parts were not whole multiples of 128 rows would silently misalign every scale
 * after the seam.
