/* rad_block_gdn_fp8.h -- the gated-delta-net block with block-scaled FP8 projections.
 *
 * THE ARCHITECTURE IS rad_block_gdn.h's AND IS DOCUMENTED THERE: that `A_log` is a log and the
 * kernels take the exponent themselves, that q and k are L2-normalised rather than RMS-normalised
 * and that this happens inside the conv/recurrent kernels, why the prefill and decode paths are two
 * declared sequences and why that is not the branch spec §2.4 forbids, and why both take
 * `num_accepted`. None of it changes with the weight format.
 *
 * ============================== a AND b SPLIT OUT; z DOES NOT ==============================
 *
 * rad_block_gdn.h fuses in_proj_qkv, in_proj_a and in_proj_b into ONE weight and one GEMM, because
 * [q|k|v|a|b] is the row gdn_conv_prep reads. THAT FUSION IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE, and the reason is
 * the checkpoint rather than a limitation:
 *
 *   in_proj_qkv.weight   F8_E4M3 [10240, 5120]   with weight_scale_inv [80, 40]
 *   in_proj_z.weight     F8_E4M3 [ 6144, 5120]   with weight_scale_inv [48, 40]
 *   in_proj_a.weight     BF16    [48, 5120]      -- no scale plane
 *   in_proj_b.weight     BF16    [48, 5120]      -- no scale plane
 *
 * a and b emit ONE COLUMN PER VALUE HEAD, 48 of them, and 48 is not a whole 128-row scale block --
 * so the quantiser that produced this checkpoint left them in bf16, and no concatenation of an
 * E4M3 tensor with a BF16 one is a tensor. They become a second, tiny bf16 `gemm_nt`: [96, 5120],
 * 0.5% of the layer's projection bytes, and the price of it is one extra launch.
 *
 * a and b are separate operands of gdn_conv_prep and gdn_recurrent_update in both blocks -- the
 * bf16 block passes them as column views of the fused row, this one as column views of their own
 * buffer -- so nothing downstream changes shape. Ref sizes its `x` read as
 * `conv_dim + (a present ? 0 : 2*H)` for precisely this case.
 *
 * THE OUTPUT GATE IS THE OPPOSITE CASE and it IS fused, into `ssm_inz`: in_proj_z is E4M3 with its
 * own scale plane, its rows are a whole number of blocks, and it reads the same normed activation.
 * So [q|k|v|z] is one weight, one launch and the same bytes -- see declare() for why one call is
 * cheaper than two. What that costs is that `w.in.x` is conv_dim + v_dim wide, and the convolution
 * and the gate are COLUMN VIEWS of it rather than buffers of their own: gdn_conv_prep,
 * gdn_conv_update and gdn_recurrent_update all take a row pitch on the operand concerned.
 *
 * ============================== THE OUT-PROJECTION'S INPUT IS RANK 3 ==============================
 *
 * `o` is [tokens, value heads, head width] because libr4d's chunk-scan and recurrent kernels
 * require rank 3 there, and it is the out-projection's activation -- so the quantiser has to accept
 * it. It does: rows are dim 0 and everything after is the row, which is the reading r4d_row_pitch
 * already takes and which the consuming GEMM's K forces. Reading it as one row per HEAD would put a
 * scale on a grid the GEMM does not read.

     * its cu ends at DT and its token operands are cut to DT rows, which agree because they are
     * the same number.
     *
     * The two ops that take no cu -- the gated norm and the standalone quantiser -- are per TOKEN,
     * so they take a row slice and are the only place DT appears as an offset.
