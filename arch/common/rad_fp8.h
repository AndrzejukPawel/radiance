/* rad_fp8.h -- the two pieces every block-scaled FP8 block is built from.
 *
 * One plugin per (architecture, quantisation) is spec §2.4, and the file-count mitigation is that
 * the blocks are COMPOSITION (rad_arch.h). This is the composed piece the FP8 blocks share and the
 * bf16 ones have no use for: a linear layer whose weight is E4M3 with a block scale plane, and the
 * activation quantiser that feeds it.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT "BLOCK-SCALED FP8" IS ==============================
 *
 * The format is the checkpoint's, not this project's. Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 -- and every other
 * `quantization_config: {quant_method: fp8, weight_block_size: [128,128]}` release -- stores each
 * linear as
 *
 *   <linear>.weight             F8_E4M3, row-major [N][K]
 *   <linear>.weight_scale_inv   BF16,    row-major [ceil(N/128)][ceil(K/128)]
 *
 * and libr4d's gemm_fp8a16_nt_m1 / gemm_fp8a8_nt_m16 / gemm_fp8a8_tiled read exactly those bytes
 * (libr4d/r4d_fp8_layout.cpp verified the grid against the real file). So rad-convert COPIES:
 * no permutation, no repacking, no dequantisation, and a .rad costs what the checkpoint does. That
 * is the whole reason this plugin family exists -- widening a 27B FP8 checkpoint to bf16 doubles
 * the weight bytes, which does not fit the device memory this engine is built for.
 *
 * ============================== WHY THE SCALE PLANE IS A WEIGHT ==============================
 *
 * `gemm_nt_q`'s operand list is `a`, `a_scale`, `b`(w), `b_scale`(w) -> `y`, so the scale plane is
 * a first-class WEIGHT OPERAND and is declared here as its own rad_weight. It is not an `aux`
 * stream on the weight, and that is not a stylistic choice:
 *
 *   - RadLayout can declare an aux stream beside a weight, but RadArgs has NO WAY TO DELIVER one
 *     to a launch (libr4d/r4d_fp8_layout.cpp reports this). An aux scale would be unreachable
 *     at run time by construction.
 *   - a weight can be placed, moved and load-time SHARDED on its own. The engine slices a
 *     row-sharded [136,40] plane at dim 0 exactly as it slices the [17408,5120] weight, and an aux
 *     stream has no shard axis at all.
 *
 * The cost is one extra declared weight per linear -- 2.1 KiB of scales against 89 MiB of weight at
 * gate_proj's shape -- and one extra name-map entry, which is `<src>_scale_inv` and is derived
 * here rather than spelled at every call site.
 *
 * ============================== WHY THE ACTIVATIONS ARE FP8 TOO ==============================
 *
 * `dtype` is ONE string per declared op, so a linear is `fp8a16` or `fp8a8` and cannot be both.
 * fp8a16 reads a bf16 activation directly and needs no quantise launch, which is strictly better --
 * and its kernel is `M <= 1`. One row. That serves a single-sequence decode and nothing else: at
 * two concurrent sequences M is 2 and there is no kernel. So the shipped path is `fp8a8`, whose two
 * kernels between them cover every M (`nt_m16` to 16, `tiled` above), and the price is one
 * `quant_act_fp8` launch per activation that feeds a GEMM.
 *
 * PER ACTIVATION, NOT PER LINEAR. The three attention projections all read the post-norm hidden
 * state, and the GDN block's in and z projections both read it; quantising once and pointing every
 * linear at the same pair is the difference between one launch a layer and five. That is why
 * QuantFP8 is a separate struct from LinearFP8 rather than a step inside it.

/* HOW MANY TOKEN ROWS THE fp8a16 MATVEC COVERS, which is the one number that decides both which
 * GEMM a linear issues and whether the quantiser in front of it runs at all.
 *
 * IT IS ONE ROW. The multi-row matvec reads the weight once for all M rows, so widening the band
 * looks free; it is not. The matvec is issue-bound above one row: the per-row work is 27
 * instructions per 16 weight bytes and eight rows of it do not fit in the issue budget, so
 * effective weight bandwidth falls as M rises on identical weight traffic
 * (r4d_gemm_fp8a16_nt_m1.hip has the ISA counts). The fp8a8 tile's cost is flat in M to 16, so it
 * wins from two rows up and the crossover is not near eight.
 *
 * SO THE SHIPPED PATH IS W8A8, which is also what the checkpoint is: `quant=fp8_e4m3` with
 * `activation_scheme: dynamic`, and prefill always quantises. A deployment that speculates
 * runs T = 1 + n_spec on every trunk step, so it is W8A8 end to end and decode computes the
 * same function prefill does.
 *
 * WHAT ONCE KEPT A ROW FOR THE MATVEC was the standalone `quant_act_fp8` in front of every linear
 * -- one launch per activation per layer -- which the fp8a8 path needs and this one does not. The
 * fusions below remove it: the producer that feeds a linear quantises in its own epilogue
 * (`rmsnorm_quant_fp8`, `gated_quant_fp8`, `gate_quant_fp8`), so the fp8a8 path pays no extra
 * launch and the last argument for a wider matvec band goes with it. */
/* ...AND IT IS DECLINED, because of where the fp8 weight is stored and what the matvec can read.
 *
 * The fp8 weight is stored in WMMA FRAGMENT ORDER (libr4d/r4d_fp8_frag.h): a (16 row, 64 k) tile
 * laid out as 32 lanes x 32 bytes, which is what lets the two fp8a8 GEMMs read a fragment straight
 * from a coalesced global load instead of transposing 16 rows through LDS. Both of them do, and
 * both are checked against the host reference.
 *
 * The matvec is built on the opposite premise -- "a lane reads 16 CONSECUTIVE k of one row", in
 * three separate read paths with their own RB blocking -- and 16 consecutive k of a row are not
 * contiguous in fragment order. Converting it is a rewrite of a tuned kernel, not an edit, so it
 * is not done here and the op is not declared rather than declared and wrong.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS is the one-row band falling back to the fp8a8 tile, which serves M <= 16 and
 * therefore covers it. A deployment that speculates never takes this band at all: T is
 * 1 + n_spec on every trunk step. */

/* ================================== the quantiser folded into the op that PRODUCES the row
 *
 * QuantFP8 above is the standalone launch, and two thirds of them do not have to be. A decode
 * step issues ~300 quantisers across both ranks, and each is dominated by launch cost rather than
 * arithmetic: the work is 82 KiB of row. What it costs is a launch, a grid fill, and a second
 * pass over a row the previous kernel had in registers -- and for ~190 of the ~300 the previous
 * kernel is right there in the same block:
 *
 *     rmsnorm -> quant     the input of every attention, GDN and MLP linear
 *     silu_mul -> quant    down_proj's input
 *
 * libr4d's `rmsnorm_quant_fp8` and `gated_quant_fp8` are those two producers with the quantiser on
 * the same pass. They still write the bf16 output the unfused producer wrote -- the fp8a16 matvec
 * reads it at one row -- and they take the codes over the BF16-ROUNDED value, so the bytes are the
 * unfused pair's exactly and generated text does not move.
 *
 * AND THE RESIDUAL ADD FOLDS IN TOO, which is another ~130 launches. `add` is the cheapest kernel
 * in the model and is almost entirely launch cost: 82 KiB of row is negligible traffic beside it.
 * Every block in this architecture ends the same way -- out-projection into
 * the shared `h` buffer, all-reduce, `x += h` -- and every block BEGINS with a norm of `x`. So the
 * add moves from the end of one block to the front of the next, where a kernel is already reading
 * both buffers, and `fold` is what says a block has a predecessor to add.
 *
 * The kernel rounds the sum to bf16 and STORES it before normalising, which is not what the int8
 * sibling does: that one keeps the f32 sum, which is more accurate. This one reproduces the pair
 * it replaces to the byte, and byte-identical output across builds is the property this engine is
 * checked against.
 *
 * THE FOLDED FORM HAS NO min_rows. QuantFP8 declines to run below the matvec's band
 * because it would be producing bytes nobody reads; there is nothing to decline when the write is
 * two stores on a pass that happens anyway. */
/* WHETHER THE ALL-REDUCE AT `T` ROWS WILL GO OUT ON THE EXACT WIRE, which is the one question the

 * wire, a message the rotation's group of 64 does not tile, or a message under the floor. Get this
 * wrong in the optimistic direction and a step issues the fused kernel where the collective needed
 * the compressed payload; get it wrong the other way and the pair runs, which merely costs the
