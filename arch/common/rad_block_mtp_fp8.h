/* rad_block_mtp_fp8.h -- the multi-token-prediction head, with block-scaled FP8 projections.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT IS ==============================
 *
 * Qwen3.5 / Qwen3-Next ship ONE extra transformer layer beside the trunk, under an `mtp.` prefix
 * of its own, whose job is to predict token i+2 from the trunk's hidden state at i and the
 * embedding of the token at i+1. It is the drafter for speculative decoding, and it is a drafter
 * with no second checkpoint: the embedding table and the lm_head are the trunk's
 * (`mtp_use_dedicated_embeddings: false`, and no `mtp.lm_head` in the file).
 *
 * THE INDEXING IS THE WHOLE THING, so it is stated once here and everything else follows:
 *
 *     head index i    reads  hidden(i) and embed(token at i + 1)
 *                     writes its K and V at KV position i, with rope position i
 *                     predicts the token at i + 2
 *
 * That is DeepSeek-V3's MTP layout, which this family follows: the head's transformer block runs
 * over the SAME position indices as the trunk, and the shift lives entirely in which token gets
 * embedded. Getting it off by one costs nothing visible -- the drafts are simply wrong and the
 * acceptance rate collapses, while the model's own output stays exactly correct.
 *
 * The forward is short and every piece of it already exists in this library:
 *
 *     h = gather(the trunk's final hidden states, at the rows this pass continues from)
 *     e = embed(the token one position on)
 *     x = fc( concat( pre_fc_norm_embedding(e), pre_fc_norm_hidden(h) ) )
 *     x = one gated-GQA layer + one SwiGLU feed-forward, over x            <- AttnGatedFP8, MlpFP8
 *     h'= mtp.norm(x)
 *     logits = the TRUNK's lm_head over h'
 *
 * and h' is BOTH the logits input and the `h` of the next draft round. That is the reference's
 * shape too: a Qwen3-Next MTP forward returns one tensor and the proposer feeds the same tensor
 * back, unlike an EAGLE head which returns a (normed, unnormed) pair.
 *
 * ============================== THE TWO KINDS OF PASS ==============================
 *
 * RadBatch::draft_pass says which, and the sign is the whole distinction:
 *
 *   < 0   A HISTORY PASS, one row a token, gathering the trunk's hidden states. It exists
 *         because the head's attention reads its OWN K and V for every earlier position, and
 *         nothing else in the engine writes those: the trunk's prefill fills layers 0..n-1 and
 *         leaves the head's layer untouched. Without it the head attends to whatever the pool
 *         last held, which is not wrong output -- a bad draft is only a rejected draft -- but it
 *         is a drafter that proposes noise. The scheduler runs one over the positions the last
 *         step added, the verified ones included.
 *
 *         It is also DRAFT ROUND 1 for every sequence that drafts: that sequence's last history
 *         row is the committed position with the token the trunk chose after it -- round 1's
 *         whole input -- so the pass ends in the lm_head over those rows (RadBatch::draft_out_ids)
 *         and leaves the head's output at them where round 2 reads it.
 *
 *   > 1   A DRAFT ROUND, one row a sequence, reading the head's own output from the round before,
 *         which is already in the same buffer. Every round ends in the lm_head, because a draft is
 *         a token. There is no round-1 pass; the history pass is it.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS AND IS NOT FP8 ==============================
 *
 * Read off mtp.safetensors rather than assumed, exactly as qwen35_fp8.cpp reads the trunk:
 *
 *   F8_E4M3 + scale   layers.0.self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj, layers.0.mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj
 *   BF16, no scale    fc, norm, pre_fc_norm_embedding, pre_fc_norm_hidden, and every norm inside
 *                     the layer
 *
 * `fc` is [5120, 10240] and bf16, so it is a plain `gemm_nt`, issued ONCE over the whole chunk.
 * libr4d's bf16 GEMM row for this shape is C_LE("M", 65536) and K here is 10240, a multiple of 16,
 * so the wide row serves the whole chunk in one launch. That matters because the history pass runs
 * one row a TOKEN over a whole prefill chunk: banding this at 64 and slicing it would be dozens of
 * launches a chunk for a GEMM whose traffic is microseconds.
 *
 * ============================== THE CONCAT ORDER ==============================
 *
 * `fc` reads 10240 columns and the two halves are the normed embedding and the normed hidden
 * state. WHICH HALF IS FIRST IS NOT IN THE CHECKPOINT: both orders are one contiguous [5120,10240]
 * matrix and no shape, name or dtype distinguishes them. DeepSeek-V3's MTP -- the design this one
 * follows -- concatenates `enorm(embedding)` then `hnorm(hidden)`, and that is the order here.
 *
 * Both readings are self-consistent, libref shares whichever one the graph picks, and no per-op
 * oracle can reach it -- but it has a CHEAP EMPIRICAL ANSWER, the draft acceptance rate. A head
 * wired the right way round accepts most of what it proposes; wired the wrong way round it
 * proposes noise and accepts nothing, while the model's own output stays perfectly correct
 * because a rejected draft costs only time.
 *
 * ============================== THE NORM GAINS ==============================
 *
 * GemmaRMSNorm's `1 + w` (Geom::wadd) applies here and the checkpoint proves it rather than
 * suggesting it: pre_fc_norm_hidden sits at -0.06 .. -0.24 and pre_fc_norm_embedding at
 * -0.27 .. -0.61 -- NEGATIVE gains, which only `1 + w` explains. `mtp.norm` sits at 0.59 .. 1.31,
 * which reads as either, so it takes the same `final_wadd` the trunk's output norm takes -- one
 * question, asked once, answered in one place.
 *
 * ============================== THE KV CACHE ==============================
 *
 * The head's attention layer is bound to the TRUNK'S full-attention group as one more layer, at
 * absolute index n_main. Two reasons, and neither is thrift:
 *
 *   - the slot mapping and the block table are the trunk's. The head writes its K and V at the
 *     slot the trunk's token for that position occupies, so a rejected draft's entry is
 *     overwritten by the next step's correct token AT THE SAME ADDRESS. Draft rounds run in
 *     position order and each writes its own position before attending to it, so there is no
 *     rollback to get wrong -- which is why vLLM's EAGLE/MTP proposer needs no second block
 *     manager either.
 *   - a second group would need its own page geometry, its own free list and its own eviction,
 *     for a cache one seventeenth the size of the one already there.
 *
 * The cost is that the group's page grows from 16 layers to 17 -- 6% more attention KV -- and it
 * is paid only when the deployment declares speculation, because that is when the head is
 * declared at all.

    /* ---- THE 2-BIT DRAFT HEAD -------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * `logits_gemm` IS ALREADY AT THE MEMORY ROOFLINE for the bf16 lm_head's 2.54 GB, so the only
     * lever it has is FEWER BYTES. That matters here and not at the trunk, because a speculative
     * step runs the projection THREE times: once to verify, and once per draft round.
     *
     * The two draft ones do not need the exact distribution. A draft is a PROPOSAL; the target
     * verifies every one of them with its own untouched bf16 head, and speculative decoding is
     * distribution-preserving -- so a worse draft costs ACCEPTANCE and cannot change a token the
     * model emits. That is the one place in the step where precision buys throughput outright.
     *
     * So the drafter reads a 2-bit copy: 318 MB of codes and 40 MB of (scale, zero) dwords against
     * 2.54 GB, an eighth of the traffic. It is a logical weight of its own over the checkpoint's
     * head (mtp_draft_head_q2), quantised by the recipe; libr4d's `gemm_w2a8_nt` takes its codes
     * and its scale and zero planes as two operands and lays them out as `r4d.w2a8.frag.g128` at
     * load (libr4d/r4d_layout.cpp). The grid is asymmetric -- four levels are not enough for a
     * symmetric one -- which is why the activation side is `quant_act_i8`'s three-output form: the
     * per-group row sums are what subtract the stored zero.
     *
     * AND IT DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE SAMPLER. The 2-bit GEMM writes bf16 and the sampler's chain
     * reads the f32 logits plane, so a draft round would need a cast of a 248K-wide row to reach
     * it -- for an argmax. `row_topk` at R=1 is that argmax, on the bf16 the GEMM already wrote,
     * and the engine reads the proposed id straight out of `didx`. The trunk's logits plane is
     * left alone, which is also what lets a draft round sample nothing at all.

         * make every rank propose only tokens from its own half. Replicating it costs 341 MiB a
         * card at 2 bits (against the 1.27 GiB a rank saves on the trunk head) and keeps the
         * draft path a single-rank computation, which is what it is.
