/* rad_block_attn_gated.h -- one GATED grouped-query attention block, bf16 operands, paged KV.
 *
 *   rmsnorm -> q|gate gemm, k gemm, v gemm -> qk-norm + rope + gate extraction
 *   -> kv_store -> paged attention -> attn * sigmoid(gate) -> o gemm -> [all_reduce] -> residual
 *
 * This is Qwen3.5's attention and not Qwen3's, and the difference is not a flag:
 *
 *   * `q_proj` emits the query AND a per-head output gate INTERLEAVED at a pitch of 2*head_dim.
 *     Head h's query is at h*2*head_dim and its gate at h*2*head_dim + head_dim, so neither is a
 *     contiguous half of the projection and both are strided views of one buffer. libr4d's
 *     `qk_norm_rope_gate` splits [q|gate] per head and takes the stride off the `qg` OPERAND's own
 *     row pitch, so the interleaved layout is the one to declare rather than to convert away at
 *     load. There is no `qg_pitch` PARAMETER to pass -- see pQkNormRopeGate in
 *     libr4d/r4d_rows.cpp -- the stride comes from the operand.
 *   * The gate multiplies the attention OUTPUT -- `out = attn * sigmoid(gate)` -- so it is
 *     extracted before attention and consumed after it. `output_gate_type: "swish"` in the config
 *     names the GDN block's gate, not this one; llama.cpp uses sigmoid here and it is ground truth
 *     (../llama.cpp/src/models/qwen35.cpp, build_layer_attn).
 *   * RoPE is PARTIAL -- `partial_rotary_factor` 0.25 rotates the first 64 of 256 head dims -- and
 *     it is MROPE. See the note on `mode` in declare(): with one position component per token,
 *     which is all RadBatch carries, mrope and neox are the same arithmetic, and that equality is
 *     what makes this declaration honest for text and wrong for an image span.
 *
 * K AND V ARE NOT FUSED INTO ONE PROJECTION, and that is a decision with a cost: two GEMM launches
 * a layer instead of one, and two movement units instead of one. It buys every consumer a
 * CONTIGUOUS operand. A fused [k|v] row makes the per-head k norm a rank-2 column slice whose last
 * dimension is kv_dim while the norm's width is head_dim, and a kernel that reads extents off its
 * operands -- libref does, by rule -- then walks it as if it were contiguous and normalises
 * across the k/v seam. The fused form is expressible the moment the slice carries the head
 * dimension in its own right; until then this is correct and slightly slow rather than fast and
 * silently wrong. libr4d's kernel takes a `k_pitch` for the fused form, so the w8a8 sibling can
 * make the other choice without changing this block's shape.

     * text that is not an approximation: every rotary dimension has its own frequency and the

     * bit-identical to neox. It stops being identical the moment an image span gives the
