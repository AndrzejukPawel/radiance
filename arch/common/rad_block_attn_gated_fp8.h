/* rad_block_attn_gated_fp8.h -- the gated GQA block with block-scaled FP8 projections.
 *
 * THE ARCHITECTURE IS rad_block_attn_gated.h's AND IS DOCUMENTED THERE: the interleaved query/gate
 * projection and why it is declared rank 3, the partial mrope and what is not expressible about it,
 * why k and v are not fused, why the fused qk_norm_rope_gate probe is withdrawn, and why the gate
 * is a sigmoid. None of that changes with the weight format and none of it is repeated here.
 *
 * What differs:
 *
 *   - q|gate, k, v and o are LinearFP8 -- an E4M3 weight with a bf16 [N/128][K/128] scale plane
 *     declared as a weight of its own, through `gemm_nt_q` at dtype fp8a8.
 *   - two `quant_act_fp8` launches a layer, not four: the three input projections all read the
 *     post-norm hidden state, so one quantise feeds all three, and the output projection gets its
 *     own because it reads the gated attention output.
 *   - everything between the GEMMs -- the per-head norms, rope, kv_store, attn_paged, the sigmoid
 *     and the gate multiply -- is UNCHANGED and still bf16.
 *   - THE KV CACHE'S WIDTH IS `g.kv_dtype` AND NOT `g.dtype`. `dtype` follows the WEIGHTS;
 *     "the cache is bf16 because the weights are fp8" is true of this checkpoint and is not a
 *     rule. `kv_dtype` follows the CACHE, which is a deployment choice: the fp8kv attention family
 *     and its descale operands are in libr4d, and the cache dtype is what selects them.
 *     Both the attention op and kv_store take it, so the two cannot disagree about the width of
 *     the thing one writes and the other reads.
 *
 * The q|gate projection is [2*n_head*head_dim, n_embd] = [12288, 5120] at 27B, and its scale plane
 * is [96, 40]. Row-sharding by head keeps whole 128-row scale blocks together only because
 * 2*head_dim is 512, a multiple of 128 -- so a rank's slice of the head range is a whole number of
 * scale rows. LinearFP8 checks that rather than trusting it.
