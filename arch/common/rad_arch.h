/* rad_arch.h -- the scaffolding an architecture plugin sits on.
 *
 * spec.md §2.4 commits to one plugin per (architecture, quantisation). That is deliberate: a w4a8
 * model wants rmsnorm_had_quant_i8 where a bf16 model wants a plain rmsnorm, and pretending
 * otherwise means a plugin full of branches on a quant descriptor -- which is how you get back to
 * "unclear what actually runs". A declare function with no branches in it is a readable list of
 * what this model does, in order.
 *
 * The file-count mitigation for the quant axis is this library. It is header-only, it is C++
 * (nothing here crosses an .so boundary -- only the four exported C symbols do), and it holds one
 * small struct per transformer block with a declare() and a step(). A plugin is COMPOSITION.

 *
 * A block that wants to characterise one of its own activations declares an f32 [K, K] PERSIST
 * buffer and a `gram_accum` op into it, then calls calib_write() when the corpus is done. These
 * three helpers are the parts that are not block-specific: whether it is on, when to stop, and
 * the file.
 *
 * PERSIST AND NOT TRANSIENT, and that is the whole reason this is not a debug probe: a transient
 * buffer is liveness-analysed and may share storage with any other transient, so an accumulator
 * declared transient would be overwritten between the launches it is meant to sum.
 *
 * THE CONSUMER IS ANOTHER PROCESS. rad-convert reads these files; the engine writes them. That
 * is not an architectural preference but the only order that works -- GPTQ needs the Hessian of
 * a layer's real input, which needs the model running, and a container is written before it can
 * be served. The bootstrap is: convert with plain absmax, serve THAT, calibrate on it, convert
 * again with the Hessians. A second moment is robust to the small perturbation the first
 * container's own error puts on the activation.
 *
 * PER RANK, AND THE CONSUMER SUMS. Under expert parallelism a rank's `down` input is only the
 * tokens routed to ITS experts, so no single rank holds the layer's distribution. Its `gate_up`
 * input is the whole token set on every rank, so summing those double-counts by `world` -- which
 * is a positive scale on H, and GPTQ is invariant to one (the damping is a fraction of the trace
 * and the update uses ratios). So one rule, sum everything, and the gate_up case is harmless. */

 * operand handed over at its declared extent means a single-row decode computed over all 8192 rows
 * of an arena buffer -- reading uninitialised memory and writing over the next op's input.
 *
 * So the run phase narrows, and these three helpers are how. `rows` is dim 0, which is tokens for
