/* rad_qsa.h -- Qwen4-Exp's QSA indexer: the part of a full-attention layer that decides WHICH
 * blocks of key history that layer's attention reads.
 *
 * docs/QSA.md is the decomposition and the argument; this is the declaration side of it. The
 * kernels are libr4d's `qsa_block_key`, `qsa_score` and `qsa_select`, and the sparse attention is
 * the ORDINARY `attn_paged` issued with the selection in place of the sequence's own block table
 * -- both of those are plain operands, so nothing in core/ learns what QSA is.
 *
 * WHAT IS HERE is the whole indexer: the projection and the query path, the block-key path with
 * its two states, and the score and selection the sparse attention is issued with. Below
 * `budget + ratio - 1` tokens of context the selection is EVERY visible block, so the sparse path
 * must reproduce the dense path's text byte for byte -- which is the oracle any change to this
 * file is checked against.

     * and the ABI narrows dim 0 or the last dimension and nothing between. A column slice of ONE
     * head is expressible, so the norm runs `heads` times and writes into a contiguous `q` that
     * the rotation can then take whole.
     *
     * Four extra launches a layer, and for a 128-wide row the launch IS the cost: the norms and
     * the ropes across the model's indexer layers are a real slice of a decode step against
     * microseconds of arithmetic. `op_qprep` is the fused form that replaces them.
     *
     * THE FUSED FORM IS `qk_norm_rope_gate`'S K SIDE, not a new op. That kernel already reads a
     * plain [tokens, heads, head_dim] input at the operand's OWN row pitch and writes the heads
     * contiguously -- which is exactly this projection's query half inside its `heads + 1` width
     * -- and it already rounds the norm to bf16 before rotating, because that is what a norm that
     * stores a tensor and a rope that reads it back do. The only thing its q side adds is the
     * [q|gate] split, and there is no gate here, so `n_head` 0 asks for the half that fits and
     * passes no q operands at all. Five launches a layer become one.
     *
     * IT NEEDS THE MODEL'S cos/sin TABLE and asks for nothing if it has none. The rotation is at
     * the same `rot`, `theta` and `scale` as the attention block's, so `rope_table` has already
     * written the rows this step's positions name -- and a plugin that builds no table leaves
     * `w.cos_sin` at 0 and runs the per-head norms below unchanged.
     *
     * AND ONLY UP TO `qk_fuse_rows`, WHICH IS A CORRECTNESS BOUND AND NOT A TUNING. The model
     * issues `rope_table` only for steps at or under that row count -- the fusion pays where the
     * launch is the cost, and a prefill chunk's kernels already fill the card -- so ABOVE it the
     * table rows this op would read were never written THIS step. It would rotate by another
     * step's angles: fluent text with a subtly wrong sense of position, which is the failure
     * `rope_table`'s own note calls out and which nothing downstream would flag. The bound is the
     * attention block's, off the same function, so the two cannot drift apart. */
