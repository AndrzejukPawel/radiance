/* rad_block_hc.h -- the GATED RESIDUAL, which is what Qwen4-Exp has instead of a pre-norm and a
 * residual add.
 *
 * ============================== THE RESIDUAL STREAM IS `hc` TIMES AS WIDE ==============================
 *
 * hidden_size 2560 at hc_count 4 is a 10240-wide stream. It is entered as FOUR IDENTICAL COPIES of
 * the embedding, carried through all 48 layers, and collapsed once at the end by a connection with
 * no write half. Every block -- attention or delta net, then the feed-forward, so 96 of them --
 * reads a 2560 mix of the four streams and writes its output back into all four, and both halves
 * are data-dependent:
 *
 *     read    N      = grouped_rmsnorm(h)    one rsqrt per 2560 stream, one 10240 gain, `1 + w`
 *             g      = sigmoid(mix_up @ silu(mix_down @ N / hc))
 *             x      = mean over the four streams of g * N            -> the block's input
 *             inj[s] = 2 * sigmoid(inject_w[s] . N / hc)              -> four scalars in (0, 2)
 *     write   h[s]  += inj[s] * y                                     for each stream s
 *
 * docs/OPS.md's `hc_read` / `hc_write` rows carry the same statement and name the three choices a
 * second implementation has to match (the mix is a MEAN; each gate argument has its own `/ hc`;
 * the write adds into the UNNORMED stream).
 *
 * ============================== WHY IT IS A BLOCK AND NOT TWO CALLS ==============================
 *
 * Because the two halves share a weight set and a buffer set, and because the pairing is the
 * invariant: a read whose `inj` nothing consumes is a bug, and a write whose `inj` came from a
 * different read is a worse one. One struct declares both, holds the four weights once, and gives
 * the plugin a `read()` and a `write()` that cannot be mismatched.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHERE THAT GOES ==============================
 *
 * The arithmetic is nothing: 2 x 10240 x 320 plus 4 x 10240 is 6.6M MACs a token against the 5.9M
 * of one expert pair. The LAUNCHES are the cost. A kernel costs a dispatch whatever it computes,
 * and there are 96 connections a step, so every extra op in a connection is 96 more dispatches --
 * a real share of a decode budget measured in tens of milliseconds.
 *
 * That is why the read emits the fp8 form of `x` itself rather than leaving a `quant_act_fp8`
 * behind it, and it is why the write is a candidate to be FOLDED INTO THE PRODUCING BLOCK'S
 * EPILOGUE later (this tree's own rule: fold the quantiser into the producer, and quantise the
 * bf16 that was written). Neither the read's five ops nor the write's one are on the table as
 * separate launches.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IS NOT SHARDED ==============================
 *
 * Nothing here. The residual stream is replicated on every rank (spec §9) and so is every weight
 * in this file: 6.7 MB a connection at bf16, 1.3 GB over the model, which is the price of not
 * putting a collective inside the connection. A sharded low-rank gate would need an all-reduce
 * between `mix_down` and `mix_up` -- 96 more collectives a step, on 1280 bytes each, and a decode
 * all-reduce is mostly fixed cost whatever the message.
