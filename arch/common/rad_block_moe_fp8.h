/* rad_block_moe_fp8.h -- the ROUTED feed-forward block with block-scaled FP8 experts.

 *                            -> gate_up moe_gemm_q -> silu_mul + quant -> down moe_gemm_q

 *                            -> add -> [all_reduce] -> residual add
 *
 * IT IS rad_block_mlp_fp8.h WITH THE FEED-FORWARD ROUTED, and everything that block's header
 * argues -- why the gate/up fusion survives block scaling, why the norm and the residual add and
 * the collective are one op, why the activations between ops stay bf16 -- is argued there and not
 * repeated. What follows is only what routing changes.
 *
 * ============================== THE SHARED EXPERT IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE ==============================
 *
 * Qwen3.5-MoE runs a dense expert BESIDE the routed ones on every token, gated by a one-output
 * projection: `y = routed(x) + sigmoid(shared_gate(x)) * shared(x)`. It is `mlp.shared_expert.*`
 * and `mlp.shared_expert_gate.weight` in the checkpoint, and a block that dropped it would produce
 * a plausible distribution and the wrong model. `moe_gather` does the multiply as it sums the
 * routed slots -- see docs/OPS.md's `scale_rows` for why `mul` cannot do it, and note that the
 * gate is applied to the SCALAR before the multiply, not to the product.
 *
 * A family without one passes `Src::shared` null and the whole arm disappears, buffers included.
 *
 * ============================== WHY THE BLOCK SLICES ITS ROWS ==============================
 *
 * The expert path's intermediates are `top_k` times as tall as the step: at an 8192-token chunk and
 * top_k 8 the down-projection's input alone is 65536 rows, which at n_embd 2048 is 256 MiB of
 * transient for ONE buffer. So the block runs in passes of at most `Config::rows` tokens and its
 * buffers are declared at that height. Routing is per pass and has to be -- `expert_offset` and
 * `sorted_tok` describe the rows of one pass -- which is not an approximation: a token's routing
 * depends on that token alone, so a pass computes exactly the rows it names.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS 2048 AND THAT IS THE CHUNK, not a tuning choice: core/sched/geometry.cpp clamps
 * the prefill chunk to the linear-state checkpoint interval, which on this family is 2048, so the
 * shipped configuration is one pass and the slicing is inert. It exists so that a deployment with a
 * larger chunk does not need this file edited.
 *
 * ============================== THE EXPERT WEIGHTS ARE EIGHT RUNS ==============================
 *
 * `moe_gemm_q` takes its weights as TABLES (RAD_OPD_WTAB), and a table is a run of CONSECUTIVELY
 * DECLARED handles -- `RAD_WTAB(first, n)` names the first and the count. It takes each
 * projection's experts as TWO tables by parity, the even experts and the odd ones, because every
 * entry of a table has one geometry and a rank holding an uneven slice of each expert has two (see
 * Config::ff_lo). So the arrays are declared in separate loops -- gate_up codes, gate_up scales,
 * down codes, down scales, each for the even experts and then the odd ones -- and NOT as a group
 * per expert. Interleaving them would give runs of stride two or four, which the operand cannot
 * express; the failure would be a table whose second entry is a scale plane.
 *
 * The codes run and the scale run of a projection are two VIEWS of one stored weight -- its codes
 * plane and its scale plane (RadWeightDecl::source) -- so an expert holds two logical weights,
 * gate_up and down, and is its own movement unit (`grp_expert_slot`, slots 0 and 1) and
 * RAD_ACCESS_CONDITIONAL, which is what lets the placement planner tier them and the heat engine
 * promote the hot ones.
